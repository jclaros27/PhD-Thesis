\chapter{Introduction: modelling neural dynamics}
\pagenumbering{arabic}
This doctoral thesis unfolds in three parts, each progressively delving into higher levels of computational complexity while embracing a holistic perspective on neural network modelling across diverse spatial scales.
In this introductory chapter, we lay the foundation, offering a comprehensive overview of the essential elements that constitute the backbone of neural network modelling.
Furthermore, we navigate through various neural and synaptic models, setting the stage for the detailed exploration that follows in subsequent chapters.
Each part, however, will have its own specific introduction to the respective topic.
