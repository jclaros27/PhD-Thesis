	abstract = {Population spikes ({PS}) are built by the extracellular summation of action currents during synchronous action potential ({AP}) firing. In the hippocampal {CA}1, active dendritic invasion of {APs} ensures mixed contribution of somatic and dendritic currents to any extracellular location. We investigated the macroscopic and subcellular factors shaping the antidromic {PS} by fitting its spatiotemporal map with a multineuronal {CA}1 model in a volume conductor. Decreased summation by temporal scatter of {APs} reduced less than expected the {PS} peak in the stratum pyramidale (st. pyr.) but strongly increased the relative contribution of far dendritic currents. Increasing the number of firing cells also augmented the relative dendritic contribution to the somatic {PS}, an effect caused by the different waveform of somatic and dendritic unitary transmembrane currents ( I
              m
              ). Those from somata are short-lasting and spiky, having smaller temporal summation than those from dendrites, which are smoother and longer. The different shape of compartmental I
              m
              s is imposed by the fitting of backpropagating {APs}, which are large and fast at the soma and smaller and longer in dendrites. The maximum sodium conductance ( ḡ
              Na
              ) strongly affects the unitary {APs} at the soma, but barely the {PS} at the stratum pyramidale (st. pyr.). This occurred because somatic I
              m
              saturated at low ḡ
              Na
              due to the strong reduction of driving force during somatic {APs}, limiting the current contribution to the extracellular space. On the contrary, ḡ
              Na
              effectively defined the {PS} amplitude in the st. radiatum. The relative contribution of dendritic currents to the st. pyr. increases during the time span of the {PS}, from ∼30–40\% at the peak up to 100\% at its end, a pattern resultant from the timing of active inward currents along the somatodendritic axis, which delay during backpropagation. Extreme changes imposed on dendritic currents caused only moderate effects on the st. pyr. due to reciprocal shunting of active soma and dendrites that partially counterbalance the net amount of instant current. The amplitude of the {PS} follows an inverse relation to the internal resistance ( R
              i
              ), which turned out to be a most critical factor. Low R
              i
              facilitated the spread of {APs} into dendrites and accelerated their speed, increasing temporal overlapping of inward currents along the somatodendritic axis and yielding the best {PS} reproductions. Model reconstruction of field potentials is a powerful tool to understand the interactions between different levels of complexity. The potential use of this approach to restrain the variability of some experimental measurements is discussed.},

              o
              at the microscopic level are poorly understood. Using a {CA}1 mathematical model and experimental verification, we examined how transmembrane currents in single cells scale up in the extracellular space shaping V
              o
              . The model includes an array of 17,000 realistically modeled neurons (responsible for generating transmembrane currents) dynamically coupled to a virtual aggregate/extracellular space (responsible for V
              o
              ). The {SD} wave in different tissue bands is simulated by imposing membrane shunts in the corresponding dendritic elements as suggested by experimentally assessed drop in membrane resistance. We show that strong isopotential depolarization of wide domains (as in the main {SD} phase) produce broad central cancellation of axial and transmembrane currents in single cells. When depolarization is restricted to narrow dendritic domains (as in the late {SD} phase), the internal cancellation shrinks and the transmembrane current increases. This explains why in the laminated {CA}1 the V
              o
              is smaller in the main phase of {SD}, when both dendritic layers are seized, than in the {SD} tail restricted to an apical band. Moreover, scattering of the neuronal somatas (as in cortical regions) further decreases the aggregate V
              o
              due to the volume averaging. Although mechanistically the V
              o
              associated to {SD} is similar to customary transient fields, its changes maybe related to spatial factors in single cells rather than cell number or depolarization strength.},

	abstract = {Abstract Synchronized phase estimates between oscillating neuronal signals at the macroscale level reflect coordinated activities between neuronal assemblies. Recent electrophysiological evidence suggests the presence of significant spontaneous phase synchrony within the resting state. The purpose of this study was to investigate phase synchrony, including directional interactions, in resting state subdural electrocorticographic recordings to better characterize patterns of regional phase interactions across the lateral cortical surface during the resting state. We estimated spontaneous phase locking value ({PLV}) as a measure of functional connectivity, and phase slope index ({PSI}) as a measure of pseudo-causal phase interactions, across a broad range of canonical frequency bands and the modulation of the amplitude envelope of high gamma ({amHG}), a band that is believed to best reflect the physiological processes giving rise to the functional magnetic resonance imaging {BOLD} signal. Long-distance interactions had higher {PLVs} in slower frequencies (≤theta) than in higher ones (≥beta) with {amHG} behaving more like slow frequencies, and a general trend of increasing frequency band of significant {PLVs} when moving across the lateral surface along an anterior–posterior axis. Moreover, there was a strong trend of frontal-to-parietal directional phase synchronization, measured by {PSI} across multiple frequencies. These findings, which are likely indicative of coordinated and structured spontaneous cortical interactions, are important in the study of time scales and directional nature of resting state functional connectivity, and may ultimately contribute to a better understanding of how spontaneous synchrony is linked to variation in regional architecture across the lateral cortical surface.},

This mutual entrainment is provoked due to the mutual (bidirectional) coupling between the two oscillators. In experiments, this bidirectional coupling is achieved by immersing a pair of anodes (oscillators) in a common electrolytic solution. A voltage mismatch between these anodes renders the time period of the uncoupled oscillators non-identical. Moreover, the coupling strength between the two oscillators is uniquely determined by the Euclidean distance separating them. Systematically varying the distance between these two anodes as a function of their voltage mismatch, phase locked domains were located. Subsequently, Arnold tongue structures were constructed in the experiments. Numerical simulations, using a model for electrochemical corrosion, corroborate our experimental findings.},

	abstract = {Abstract The human brain is often considered to be the most cognitively capable among mammalian brains and to be much larger than expected for a mammal of our body size. Although the number of neurons is generally assumed to be a determinant of computational power, and despite the widespread quotes that the human brain contains 100 billion neurons and ten times more glial cells, the absolute number of neurons and glial cells in the human brain remains unknown. Here we determine these numbers by using the isotropic fractionator and compare them with the expected values for a human-sized primate. We find that the adult male human brain contains on average 86.1 ± 8.1 billion {NeuN}-positive cells (“neurons”) and 84.6 ± 9.8 billion {NeuN}-negative (“nonneuronal”) cells. With only 19\% of all neurons located in the cerebral cortex, greater cortical size (representing 82\% of total brain mass) in humans compared with other primates does not reflect an increased relative number of cortical neurons. The ratios between glial cells and neurons in the human brain structures are similar to those found in other primates, and their numbers of cells match those expected for a primate of human proportions. These findings challenge the common view that humans stand out from other primates in their brain composition and indicate that, with regard to numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal cells, the human brain is an isometrically scaled-up primate brain.

Thus, it appears as if many different gamma-band synchronization phenomena subserve many different functions. I argue that gamma-band synchronization is a fundamental process that subserves an elemental operation of cortical computation. Cortical computation unfolds in the interplay between neuronal dynamics and structural neuronal connectivity. A core motif of neuronal connectivity is convergence, which brings about both selectivity and invariance of neuronal responses. However, those core functions can be achieved simultaneously only if converging neuronal inputs are functionally segmented and if only one segment is selected at a time. This segmentation and selection can be elegantly achieved if structural connectivity interacts with neuronal synchronization. I propose that this process is at least one of the fundamental functions of gamma-band synchronization, which then subserves numerous higher cognitive functions.},

	abstract = {Recent findings in neuroscience strongly suggest that an object's features (e.g., its color, texture, shape, etc.) are represented in separate areas of the visual cortex. Although represented in separate neuronal areas, somehow the feature representations are brought together as a single, unified object of visual consciousness. This raises a question of binding: how do neural activities in separate areas of the visual cortex function to produce a feature-unified object of visual consciousness? Several prominent neuroscientists have adopted neural synchrony and attention-based approaches to explain object feature binding. I argue that although neural synchrony and/or attentional mechanisms might function to disambiguate an object's features, it is difficult to see how either of these mechanisms could fully explain the unity of an object's features at the level of visual consciousness. After presenting a detailed critique of neural synchrony and attention-based approaches to object feature binding, I propose interactive hierarchical structuralism ({IHS}). This view suggests that a unified percept (i.e., a feature-unified object of visual consciousness) is not reducible to the activity of any cognitive capacity or to any localized neural area, but emerges out of the interaction of visual information organized by spatial structuring capacities correlated with lower, higher, and intermediate levels of the visual hierarchy. After clarifying different notions of emergence and elaborating evidence for {IHS}, I discuss how {IHS} can be tested through transcranial magnetic stimulation and masking. In the final section I present some further implications/advantages of {IHS}.},

	abstract = {Rhythmic neuronal activity in the gamma range is a signature of cortical processing and its synchronization across distant sites has been proposed as a fundamental mechanism of network interactions. While this has been shown within sensory streams, we tested whether cross talk between the senses relies on similar mechanisms. Direct sensory interactions in humans (male and female) were studied with a visual–tactile amplitude matching paradigm. In this task, congruent stimuli are associated with behavioral benefits, which are proposed to be mediated by increased binding between sensory cortices through coherent gamma oscillations. We tested this hypothesis by applying 4-in-1 multi-electrode transcranial alternating current stimulation ({tACS}) with 40 Hz over visual and somatosensory cortices. In phase stimulation (0°) was expected to strengthen binding and thereby enhance the congruence effect, while anti-phase (180°) stimulation was expected to have opposite effects. Gamma {tACS} was controlled by alpha (10 Hz) and sham stimulation, as well as by applying {tACS} unilaterally while visual–tactile stimuli were presented lateralized. Contrary to our expectations, gamma {tACS} over the relevant hemisphere delayed responses to congruent trials. Additionally, reanalysis of {EEG} data revealed decoupling of sensory gamma oscillations during congruent trials. We propose that gamma {tACS} prevented sensory decoupling and thereby limited the congruence effect. Together, our results favor the perspective that processing multisensory congruence involves corticocortical communication rather than feature binding. Furthermore, we found control stimulation over the irrelevant hemisphere to speed responses under alpha stimulation and to delay responses under gamma stimulation, consistent with the idea that contralateral alpha/gamma dynamics regulate cortical excitability.},

	abstract = {The extreme complexity of the brain naturally requires mathematical modeling approaches on a large variety of scales; the spectrum ranges from single neuron dynamics over the behavior of groups of neurons to neuronal network activity. Thus, the connection between the microscopic scale (single neuron activity) to macroscopic behavior (emergent behavior of the collective dynamics) and vice versa is a key to understand the brain in its complexity. In this work, we attempt a review of a wide range of approaches, ranging from the modeling of single neuron dynamics to machine learning. The models include biophysical as well as data-driven phenomenological models. The discussed models include Hodgkin–Huxley, {FitzHugh}–Nagumo, coupled oscillators (Kuramoto oscillators, Rössler oscillators, and the Hindmarsh–Rose neuron), Integrate and Fire, networks of neurons, and neural field equations. In addition to the mathematical models, important mathematical methods in multiscale modeling and reconstruction of the causal connectivity are sketched. The methods include linear and nonlinear tools from statistics, data analysis, and time series analysis up to differential equations, dynamical systems, and bifurcation theory, including Granger causal connectivity analysis, phase synchronization connectivity analysis, principal component analysis ({PCA}), independent component analysis ({ICA}), and manifold learning algorithms such as {ISOMAP}, and diffusion maps and equation-free techniques. {WIREs} Syst Biol Med 2016, 8:438–458. doi: 10.1002/wsbm.1348 This article is categorized under: Analytical and Computational Methods ¿ Computational Methods Developmental Biology ¿ Developmental Processes in Health and Disease Models of Systems Properties and Processes ¿ Mechanistic Models},

	abstract = {A rich repertoire of oscillatory signals is detected from human brains with electro- and magnetoencephalography ({EEG}/{MEG}). However, the principles underwriting coherent oscillations and their link with neural activity remain under debate. Here, we revisit the mechanistic hypothesis that transient brain rhythms are a signature of metastable synchronization, occurring at reduced collective frequencies due to delays between brain areas. We consider a system of damped oscillators in the presence of background noise – approximating the short-lived gamma-frequency oscillations generated within neuronal circuits – coupled according to the diffusion weighted tractography between brain areas. Varying the global coupling strength and conduction speed, we identify a critical regime where spatially and spectrally resolved metastable oscillatory modes ({MOMs}) emerge at sub-gamma frequencies, approximating the {MEG} power spectra from 89 healthy individuals at rest. Further, we demonstrate that the frequency, duration, and scale of {MOMs} – as well as the frequency-specific envelope functional connectivity – can be controlled by global parameters, while the connectome structure remains unchanged. Grounded in the physics of delay-coupled oscillators, these numerical analyses demonstrate how interactions between locally generated fast oscillations in the connectome spacetime structure can lead to the emergence of collective brain rhythms organized in space and time.},

The existing work on each of these factors has mainly focused on special cases. With new angles and tools, this paper makes progress in relaxing some assumptions on these factors. There are three main results in this paper. Firstly, by using results from algebraic graph theory, a sufficient condition is obtained that can be used to check equilibrium stability. This condition works for arbitrary topology, generalizing existing results and also leading to a sufficient condition on the coupling function which guarantees that the system will reach synchronization. Secondly, it is known that identical oscillators with sin () coupling functions are guaranteed to synchronize in phase on a complete graph. Our results prove that in many cases certain structures such as symmetry and concavity, rather than the exact shape of the coupling function, are the keys for global synchronization. Finally, the effect of heterogenous delays is investigated. Using mean field theory, a system of delayed coupled oscillators is approximated by a non-delayed one whose coupling depends on the delay distribution. This shows how the stability properties of the system depend on the delay distribution and allows us to predict its behavior. In particular, we show that for sin () coupling, heterogeneous delays are equivalent to homogeneous delays. Furthermore, we can use our novel sufficient instability condition to show that heterogeneity, i.e. wider delay distribution, can help reach in-phase synchronization.},

	abstract = {Synchronization has been studied extensively in the context of weakly coupled oscillators using the so-called phase response curve ({PRC}) which measures how a change of the phase of an oscillator is affected by a small perturbation. This approach was based upon the work of Malkin, and it has been extended to relaxation oscillators. Namely, synchronization conditions were established under the weak coupling assumption, leading to a criterion for the existence of synchronous solutions of weakly coupled relaxation oscillators. Previous analysis relies on the fact that the slow nullcline does not intersect the fast nullcline near one of its fold points, where canard solutions can arise. In the present study we use numerical continuation techniques to solve the adjoint equations and we show that synchronization properties of canard cycles are different than those of classical relaxation cycles. In particular, we highlight a new special role of the maximal canard in separating two distinct synchronization regimes: the Hopf regime and the relaxation regime. Phase plane analysis of slow–fast oscillators undergoing a canard explosion provides an explanation for this change of synchronization properties across the maximal canard.},

	title = {Synaptic Granger Causality: A New Approach to Untangling Excitatory and Inhibitory Connectivities},
	abstract = {Interactions between brain signals are often measured in terms of information ﬂow. However, when solving the inverse problem—characterizing the structure behind a speciﬁc functional link—there are many possibilities with very different consequences. Excitation and inhibition, for instance, may each produce a causal dependence by coordinating neuronal populations, but inhibitory connections do not transmit information packages. Here, we introduce the concept of synaptic Granger causality ({sGC}), an extension of the well-known Granger causality approach that quantiﬁes the ratio of excitatory/inhibitory projections involved in a functional link on the basis of the analysis of time series constructed using autoregressive models. The method is validated by using the membrane potential obtained from numerical simulations of neuronal motifs that mimic extracellular brain activity, similar to the experimentally measured local ﬁeld potential. When excitatory and inhibitory synapses are not mixed, the method correctly predicts the type of synapses that participate in the signaling. Moreover, when both inputs project on the same neuron or population, the {sGC} estimates the proportion of both types of interaction. Our results suggest that {sGC} allows for a better inference on the anatomical structure underlying effective connectivity and its role in the information process.},

Here, we present a simple and reliable mathematical model of a moth {ORN} generating spikes.

We show that an adaptive spike threshold regulated by prior spike history is an effective mechanism for reproducing the typical phasic–tonic time course of {ORN} responses. Our model reproduces the response dynamics of individual neurons to a fluctuating stimulus that approximates odorant fluctuations in nature. The parameters of the spike threshold are essential for reproducing the response heterogeneity in {ORNs}. The model provides a valuable tool for efficient simulations of olfactory circuits.},

	abstract = {The behaviour-contingent rhythmic synchronization of neuronal activity is reported by local field potential oscillations in the theta, gamma and sharp wave-related ripple ({SWR}) frequency ranges. In the hippocampus, pyramidal cell assemblies representing temporal sequences are coordinated by {GABAergic} interneurons selectively innervating specific postsynaptic domains, and discharging phase locked to network oscillations.We compare the cellular network dynamics in the {CA}1 and {CA}3 areas recorded with or without anaesthesia. All parts of pyramidal cells, except the axon initial segment, receive {GABA} from multiple interneuron types, each with distinct firing dynamics. The axon initial segment is exclusively innervated by axo-axonic cells, preferentially firing after the peak of the pyramidal layer theta cycle, when pyramidal cells are least active. Axo-axonic cells are inhibited during {SWRs}, when many pyramidal cells fire synchronously. This dual inverse correlation demonstrates the key inhibitory role of axo-axonic cells. Parvalbumin-expressing basket cells fire phase locked to field gamma activity in both {CA}1 and {CA}3, and also strongly increase firing during {SWRs}, together with dendrite-innervating bistratified cells, phasing pyramidal cell discharge. Subcellular domain-specific {GABAergic} innervation probably developed for the coordination of multiple glutamatergic inputs on different parts of pyramidal cells through the temporally distinct activity of {GABAergic} interneurons, which differentially change their firing during different network states. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We have based this on data obtained from animals behaving freely. We have considered the modes of neuronal discharges and the occurrence of local field potential oscillations in the theta and non-theta states at different inputs from the {CA}3 field, the medial entorhinal cortex, and the medial septum. In our work, we tried to reproduce the main experimental phenomena about rhythms in the {CA}1 field: the coupling of neurons to the phase of rhythms, cross-rhythm phase-phase coupling, and phase-Significance Statement The development of models describing a large complex of experimental data are an important aim of theoretical neuroscience. We propose an approach: models of separated aspects can be used as good initial conditions for optimizing a complex model. Using this approach, we have developed a model of rhythms in the {CA}1 field. We have united theoretical ideas about the formation of theta rhythm, gamma rhythms (slow, medium, and fast), ripple oscillations, and place cells in a single model. The model explains the coupling of neuron firing to the phases of the theta rhythm, the cross-frequency phase-amplitude and phase-phase relationships of gamma rhythms and theta rhythm, the phase precession of place cells. The model reproduces ripple oscillations in the non-theta state. November/December 2021, 8(6) {ENEURO}.0192-21.2021 1-15 Research Article: New Research amplitude coupling. Using computational experiments, we have proved the hypothesis that the descending phase of the theta rhythm in the {CA}1 field is formed by the input from the {CA}3 field via the Shaffer collaterals, and the ascending phase of the theta rhythm is formed by the {IPSPs} from {CCK} basket cells. The slow gamma rhythm is coupled to the descending phase of the theta rhythm, since it also depends on the arrival of the signal via the Shaffer collaterals. The middle gamma rhythm is formed by the {EPSPs} of the principal neurons of the third layer of the entorhinal cortex, corresponds to experimental data. We were able to unite in a single mathematical model several theoretical ideas about the mechanisms of rhythmic processes in the {CA}1 field of the hippocampus.},

	abstract = {It has been shown that different inhibitory cell types underlie brain rhythmic and cross-frequency coupling output, but exactly how inhibitory cell types manifest their contributions to these outputs is far from clear. Brain rhythms and their couplings are functionally important in cognition and behaviour, and thus it is essential that we determine and understand these contributions. To do this, one needs simultaneous access to multiple cell types and population brain output in functionally relevant states. This is extremely challenging to do with experiments alone, and here we use mathematical models of different types to gain insight into the contributions of the different inhibitory cell types. We focus on theta and gamma rhythms in the hippocampus and use a previously developed detailed model to develop precise hypotheses of how these rhythms are generated and coupled. We find critical contributions by four different cell types - pyramidal cells, parvalbumin expressing ({PV}+) basket cells ({BCs}), cholecystokinin-expressing ({CCK}+) {BCs} and bistratified cells. We develop a reduced population rate model ({PRM}) based on these hypotheses and do extensive explorations and visualizations of the {PRM} to obtain testable predictions. We find that {CCK}+{BCs} exhibit a much higher degree of control relative to {PV}+{BCs} for theta or gamma rhythm dominance and thus their coupling, and that coupling from {PV}+{BCs} to {CCK}+{BCs} more strongly affects theta frequencies relative to coupling from {CCK}+{BCs} to {PV}+{BCs}. As it is now possible to target these specific inhibitory cell types in the behaving animal, experimentally testing these hypotheses and predictions would be possible. Moreover, our work shows that a variety of mathematical model types creates new insights that would not be revealed with a single model type.},

	abstract = {We have constructed a detailed model of a hippocampal dentate granule ({DG}) cell that includes nine different channel types. Channel densities and distributions were chosen to reproduce reported physiological responses observed in normal solution and when blockers were applied. The model was used to explore the contribution of each channel type to spiking behavior with particular emphasis on the mechanisms underlying postspike events. T-type calcium current in more distal dendrites contributed prominently to the appearance of the depolarizing after-potential, and its effect was controlled by activation of {BK}-type calcium-dependent potassium channels. Coactivation and interaction of N-, and/or L-type calcium and {AHP} currents present in somatic and proximal dendritic regions contributed to the adaptive properties of the model {DG} cell in response to long-lasting current injection. The model was used to predict changes in channel densities that could lead to epileptogenic burst discharges and to predict the effect of altered buffering capacity on ﬁring behavior. We conclude that the clustered spatial distributions of calcium related channels, the presence of slow delayed rectiﬁer potassium currents in dendrites, and calcium buffering properties, together, might explain the resistance of {DG} cells to the development of epileptogenic burst discharges.},

	abstract = {The brain can be seen as a complex adaptive system ({CAS}), analogous to ant colonies, economy or the internet. {CAS} are characterized by emergence, in which an emergent property of a {CAS} is one that is not a property of any component of that system. It is the very specific connections between the components of a {CAS} that generate emergent properties. Brain connectivity can be captured as structural connectivity, functional connectivity or effective connectivity. Neuroplasticity is the capacity of the nervous system to modify its structural and functional organization to a changing environment, thereby changing its emergent properties. As such brain disorders can be considered emergent properties of altered brain connectivity. All neuromodulation techniques have in common that they change the functional and effective connectivity of the brain, thereby changing the emergent properties (e.g., brain disorder) of the neuromodulated networks. The future of neuromodulation will be based on a better understanding of how these network changes can be controlled by using better neuroimaging techniques, as well as novel stimulation devices.},

	abstract = {Deep brain stimulation ({DBS}) has been successfully applied in various neurodegenerative diseases as an effective symptomatic treatment. However, its mechanisms of action within the brain network are still poorly understood. Many virtual {DBS} models analyze a subnetwork around the basal ganglia and its dynamics as a spiking network with their details validated by experimental data. However, connectomic evidence shows widespread effects of {DBS} affecting many different cortical and subcortical areas. From a clinical perspective, various effects of {DBS} besides the motoric impact have been demonstrated. The neuroinformatics platform The Virtual Brain ({TVB}) offers a modeling framework allowing us to virtually perform stimulation, including {DBS}, and forecast the outcome from a dynamic systems perspective prior to invasive surgery with {DBS} lead placement. For an accurate prediction of the effects of {DBS}, we implement a detailed spiking model of the basal ganglia, which we combine with {TVB} via our previously developed co-simulation environment. This multiscale co-simulation approach builds on the extensive previous literature of spiking models of the basal ganglia while simultaneously offering a whole-brain perspective on widespread effects of the stimulation going beyond the motor circuit. In the first demonstration of our model, we show that virtual {DBS} can move the firing rates of a Parkinson’s disease patient’s thalamus - basal ganglia network towards the healthy regime while, at the same time, altering the activity in distributed cortical regions with a pronounced effect in frontal regions. Thus, we provide proof of concept for virtual {DBS} in a co-simulation environment with {TVB}. The developed modeling approach has the potential to optimize {DBS} lead placement and configuration and forecast the success of {DBS} treatment for individual patients.

	abstract = {The thalamus is a central brain structure that serves as a relay station for sensory inputs from the periphery to the cortex and regulates cortical arousal. Traditionally, it has been regarded as a passive relay that transmits information between brain regions. However, recent studies have suggested that the thalamus may also play a role in shaping functional connectivity ({FC}) in a task-based context. Based on this idea, we hypothesized that due to its centrality in the network and its involvement in cortical activation, the thalamus may also contribute to resting-state {FC}, a key neurological biomarker widely used to characterize brain function in health and disease. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed ten in-silico brain network models based on neuroimaging data ({MEG}, {MRI}, and {dwMRI}), and simulated them including and excluding the thalamus. and raising the noise into thalamus to represent the afferences related to the reticular activating system ({RAS}) and the relay of peripheral sensory inputs. We simulated brain activity and compared the resulting {FC} to their empirical {MEG} counterparts to evaluate model’s performance. Results showed that a parceled version of the thalamus with higher noise, able to drive damped cortical oscillators, enhanced the match to empirical {FC}. However, with an already active self-oscillatory cortex, no impact on the dynamics was observed when introducing the thalamus. We also demonstrated that the enhanced performance was not related to the structural connectivity of the thalamus, but to its higher noisy inputs. Additionally, we highlighted the relevance of a balanced signal-to-noise ratio in thalamus to allow it to propagate its own dynamics. In conclusion, our study sheds light on the role of the thalamus in shaping brain dynamics and {FC} in resting-state and allowed us to discuss the general role of criticality in the brain at the mesoscale level.},

When long-range excitation is weak, these oscillations phase lock with a phase shift dependent on the strength of local inhibition. Increasing the strength of long-range excitation induces a transition to chaos via period doubling or quasiperiodic scenarios. In the chaotic regime, oscillatory activity undergoes fast temporal decorrelation.

In the brain, they might play a fundamental role in information processing, temporal coding and spatial attention. Recent numerical work on anticipated and zero-lag synchronization studied the role of delays. However, an analytical understanding of the conditions for these phenomena remains elusive. In this paper, we study both phenomena in systems with small delays. By performing a phase reduction and studying phase locked solutions, we uncover the functional relation between the delay, excitation and inhibition for the onset of anticipated synchronization in a sender-receiverinterneuron motif. In the case of zero-lag synchronization in a chain motif, we determine the stability conditions. These analytical solutions provide an excellent prediction of the phase-locked regimes of Hodgkin-Huxley models and Roessler oscillators.},

	volume = {15},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007019},
	abstract = {Macroscopic oscillations of different brain regions show multiple phase relationships that are persistent across time and have been implicated in routing information. While multiple cellular mechanisms influence the network oscillatory dynamics and structure the macroscopic firing motifs, one of the key questions is to identify the biophysical neuronal and synaptic properties that permit such motifs to arise. A second important issue is how the different neural activity coherence states determine the communication between the neural circuits. Here we analyse the emergence of phase-locking within bidirectionally delayed-coupled spiking circuits in which global gamma band oscillations arise from synaptic coupling among largely excitable neurons. We consider both the interneuronal ({ING}) and the pyramidal-interneuronal ({PING}) population gamma rhythms and the inter coupling targeting the pyramidal or the inhibitory neurons. Using a mean-field approach together with an exact reduction method, we reduce each spiking network to a low dimensional nonlinear system and derive the macroscopic phase resetting-curves ({mPRCs}) that determine how the phase of the global oscillation responds to incoming perturbations. This is made possible by the use of the quadratic integrate-and-fire model together with a Lorentzian distribution of the bias current. Depending on the type of gamma ({PING} vs. {ING}), we show that incoming excitatory inputs can either speed up the macroscopic oscillation (phase advance; type I {PRC}) or induce both a phase advance and a delay (type {II} {PRC}). From there we determine the structure of macroscopic coherence states (phase-locking) of two weakly synaptically-coupled networks. To do so we derive a phase equation for the coupled system which links the synaptic mechanisms to the coherence states of the system. We show that a synaptic transmission delay is a necessary condition for symmetry breaking, i.e. a non-symmetric phase lag between the macroscopic oscillations. This potentially provides an explanation to the experimentally observed variety of gamma phase-locking modes. Our analysis further shows that symmetry-broken coherence states can lead to a preferred direction of signal transfer between the oscillatory networks where this directionality also depends on the timing of the signal. Hence we suggest a causal theory for oscillatory modulation of functional connectivity between cortical circuits.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002438},
	abstract = {Anatomic connections between brain areas affect information flow between neuronal circuits and the synchronization of neuronal activity. However, such structural connectivity does not coincide with effective connectivity (or, more precisely, causal connectivity), related to the elusive question "Which areas cause the present activity of which others?". Effective connectivity is directed and depends flexibly on contexts and tasks. Here we show that dynamic effective connectivity can emerge from transitions in the collective organization of coherent neural activity. Integrating simulation and semi-analytic approaches, we study mesoscale network motifs of interacting cortical areas, modeled as large random networks of spiking neurons or as simple rate units. Through a causal analysis of time-series of model neural activity, we show that different dynamical states generated by a same structural connectivity motif correspond to distinct effective connectivity motifs. Such effective motifs can display a dominant directionality, due to spontaneous symmetry breaking and effective entrainment between local brain rhythms, although all connections in the considered structural motifs are reciprocal. We show then that transitions between effective connectivity configurations (like, for instance, reversal in the direction of inter-areal interactions) can be triggered reliably by brief perturbation inputs, properly timed with respect to an ongoing local oscillation, without the need for plastic synaptic changes. Finally, we analyze how the information encoded in spiking patterns of a local neuronal population is propagated across a fixed structural connectivity motif, demonstrating that changes in the active effective connectivity regulate both the efficiency and the directionality of information transfer. Previous studies stressed the role played by coherent oscillations in establishing efficient communication between distant areas. Going beyond these early proposals, we advance here that dynamic interactions between brain rhythms provide as well the basis for the self-organized control of this "communication-through-coherence", making thus possible a fast "on-demand" reconfiguration of global information routing modalities. © 2012 Battaglia et al.},

	abstract = {Synchronization between neuronal populations plays an important role in information transmission between brain areas. In particular, collective oscillations emerging from the synchronized activity of thousands of neurons can increase the functional connectivity between neural assemblies by coherently coordinating their phases. This synchrony of neuronal activity can take place within a cortical patch or between different cortical regions. While short-range interactions between neurons involve just a few milliseconds, communication through long-range projections between different regions could take up to tens of milliseconds. How these heterogeneous transmission delays affect communication between neuronal populations is not well known. To address this question, we have studied the dynamics of two bidirectionally delayed-coupled neuronal populations using conductance-based spiking models, examining how different synaptic delays give rise to in-phase/anti-phase transitions at particular frequencies within the gamma range, and how this behavior is related to the phase coherence between the two populations at different frequencies. We have used spectral analysis and information theory to quantify the information exchanged between the two networks. For different transmission delays between the two coupled populations, we analyze how the local field potential and multi-unit activity calculated from one population convey information in response to a set of external inputs applied to the other population. The results confirm that zero-lag synchronization maximizes information transmission, although out-of-phase synchronization allows for efficient communication provided the coupling delay, the phase lag between the populations, and the frequency of the oscillations are properly matched. © 2014 Barardi et al.},

	abstract = {The formation and maintenance of spatial representations within hippocampal cell assemblies is strongly dictated by patterns of inhibition from diverse interneuron populations. Although it is known that inhibitory synaptic strength is malleable, induction of long-term plasticity at distinct inhibitory synapses and its regulation of hippocampal network activity is not well understood. Here, we show that inhibitory synapses from parvalbumin and somatostatin expressing interneurons undergo long-term depression and potentiation respectively ({PV}-{iLTD} and {SST}-{iLTP}) during physiological activity patterns. Both forms of plasticity rely on T-type calcium channel activation to confer synapse specificity but otherwise employ distinct mechanisms. Since parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons preferentially target perisomatic and distal dendritic regions respectively of {CA}1 pyramidal cells, {PV}-{iLTD} and {SST}-{iLTP} coordinate a reprioritisation of excitatory inputs from entorhinal cortex and {CA}3. Furthermore, circuit-level modelling reveals that {PV}-{iLTD} and {SST}-{iLTP} cooperate to stabilise place cells while facilitating representation of multiple unique environments within the hippocampal network.},

While often morphologically complex, their dendrites have been ignored for decades, treating them as linear point neurons. Exciting new findings reveal complex, non-linear dendritic computations that call for a new theory of interneuron arithmetic. Using detailed biophysical models, we predict that dendrites of {FS} basket cells in both hippocampus and prefrontal cortex come in two flavors: supralinear, supporting local sodium spikes within large-volume branches and sublinear, in small-volume branches. Synaptic activation of varying sets of these dendrites leads to somatic firing variability that cannot be fully explained by the point neuron reduction. Instead, a 2-stage artificial neural network ({ANN}), with sub- and supralinear hidden nodes, captures most of the variance. Reduced neuronal circuit modeling suggest that this bi-modal, 2-stage integration in {FS} basket cells confers substantial resource savings in memory encoding as well as the linking of memories across time.},

	abstract = {Inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channels allow K+ to move more easily into rather than out of the cell. They have diverse physiological functions depending on their type and their location. There are seven Kir channel subfamilies that can be classified into four functional groups: classical Kir channels (Kir2.x) are constitutively active, G protein-gated Kir channels (Kir3.x) are regulated by G protein-coupled receptors, {ATP}-sensitive K+ channels (Kir6.x) are tightly linked to cellular metabolism, and K+ transport channels (Kir1.x, Kir4.x, Kir5.x, and Kir7.x). Inward rectification results from pore block by intracellular substances such as Mg2+ and polyamines. Kir channel activity can be modulated by ions, phospholipids, and binding proteins. The basic building block of a Kir channel is made up of two transmembrane helices with cytoplasmic {NH}2 and {COOH} termini and an extracellular loop which folds back to form the pore-lining ion selectivity filter. In vivo, functional Kir channels are composed of four such subunits which are either homo- or heterotetramers. Gene targeting and genetic analysis have linked Kir channel dysfunction to diverse pathologies. The crystal structure of different Kir channels is opening the way to understanding the structure-function relationships of this simple but diverse ion channel family.},

	abstract = {In cortical networks, different types of inhibitory interneurons control the activity of glutamatergic principal cells and {GABAergic} interneurons. Principal neurons represent the major postsynaptic target of most interneurons; however, a population of interneurons that is dedicated to the selective innervation of {GABAergic} cells exists in the {CA}1 area of the hippocampus. The physiological properties of these cells and their functional relevance for network computations remain unknown. Here, we used a combination of dual simultaneous patch-clamp recordings and targeted optogenetic stimulation in acute mouse hippocampal slices to examine how one class of interneuron-specific ({IS}) cells controls the activity of its {GABAergic} targets. We found that type 3 {IS} ({IS}3) cells that coexpress the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ({VIP}) and calretinin contact several distinct types of interneurons within the hippocampal {CA}1 stratum oriens/alveus (O/A), with preferential innervation of oriens-lacunosum moleculare cells ({OLMs}) through dendritic synapses. In contrast, {VIP}-positive basket cells provided perisomatic inhibition to {CA}1 pyramidal neurons with the asynchronous {GABA} release and were not connected with O/A interneurons. Furthermore, unitary {IPSCs} recorded at {IS}3–{OLM} synapses had a small amplitude and low release probability but summated efficiently during high-frequency firing of {IS}3 interneurons. Moreover, the synchronous generation of a single spike in several {IS} cells that converged onto a single {OLM} controlled the firing rate and timing of {OLM} interneurons. Therefore, dendritic inhibition originating from {IS} cells is needed for the flexible activity-dependent recruitment of {OLM} interneurons for feedback inhibition.},

	abstract = {The hippocampus plays a key role in pattern separation, the process of transforming similar incoming information to highly dissimilar, nonverlapping representations. Sparse ﬁring granule cells ({GCs}) in the dentate gyrus ({DG}) have been proposed to undertake this computation, but little is known about which of their properties inﬂuence pattern separation. Dendritic atrophy has been reported in diseases associated with pattern separation deﬁcits, suggesting a possible role for dendrites in this phenomenon. To investigate whether and how the dendrites of {GCs} contribute to pattern separation, we build a simpliﬁed, biologically relevant, computational model of the {DG}. Our model suggests that the presence of {GC} dendrites is associated with high pattern separation efﬁciency while their atrophy leads to increased excitability and performance impairments. These impairments can be rescued by restoring {GC} sparsity to control levels through various manipulations. We predict that dendrites contribute to pattern separation as a mechanism for controlling sparsity. {VC} 2016 The Authors Hippocampus Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Based on numerical simulations and analytical arguments, we show that the amount of information transfer between two oscillating neural populations could be determined by their connection delay and the mismatch in their oscillation frequencies. Our results highlight the role of the collective phase response curve of the oscillating neural populations for the efficacy of signal transmission and the quality of the information transfer in brain networks.},

	abstract = {Background: Periodic stimulation of occipital areas using transcranial alternating current stimulation ({tACS}) at alpha (a) frequency (8e12 Hz) enhances electroencephalographic ({EEG}) a-oscillation long after {tACS}-offset. Two mechanisms have been suggested to underlie these changes in oscillatory {EEG} activity: {tACS}-induced entrainment of brain oscillations and/or {tACS}-induced changes in oscillatory circuits by spike-timing dependent plasticity.
Objective: We tested to what extent plasticity can account for {tACS}-aftereffects when controlling for entrainment “echoes.” To this end, we used a novel, intermittent {tACS} protocol and investigated the strength of the aftereffect as a function of phase continuity between successive {tACS} episodes, as well as the match between stimulation frequency and endogenous a-frequency.
Methods: 12 healthy participants were stimulated at around individual a-frequency for 11e15 min in four sessions using intermittent {tACS} or sham. Successive {tACS} events were either phase-continuous or phase-discontinuous, and either 3 or 8 s long. {EEG} a-phase and power changes were compared after and between episodes of a-{tACS} across conditions and against sham.
Results: a-aftereffects were successfully replicated after intermittent stimulation using 8-s but not 3-s trains. These aftereffects did not reveal any of the characteristics of entrainment echoes in that they were independent of {tACS} phase-continuity and showed neither prolonged phase alignment nor frequency synchronization to the exact stimulation frequency.
Conclusion: Our results indicate that plasticity mechanisms are sufﬁcient to explain a-aftereffects in response to a-{tACS}, and inform models of {tACS}-induced plasticity in oscillatory circuits. Modifying brain oscillations with {tACS} holds promise for clinical applications in disorders involving abnormal neural synchrony.},

	abstract = {In recent years the study of the intrinsic brain dynamics in a relaxed awake state in the absence of any specific task has gained increasing attention, as spontaneous neural activity has been found to be highly structured at a large scale. This so called resting-state activity has been found to be comprised by nonrandom spatiotemporal patterns and fluctuations, and several Resting-State Networks ({RSN}) have been found in {BOLD}-{fMRI} as well as in {MEG} signal power envelope correlations. The underlying anatomical connectivity structure between areas of the brain has been identified as being a key to the observed functional network connectivity, but the mechanisms behind this are still underdetermined. Theoretical large-scale brain models for {fMRI} data have corroborated the importance of the connectome in shaping network dynamics, while the importance of delays and noise differ between studies and depend on the models' specific dynamics. In the current study, we present a spiking neuron network model that is able to produce noisy, distributed alpha-oscillations, matching the power peak in the spectrum of group resting-state {MEG} recordings. We studied how well the model captured the inter-node correlation structure of the alpha-band power envelopes for different delays between brain areas, and found that the model performs best for propagation delays inside the physiological range (5-10. m/s). Delays also shift the transition from noisy to bursting oscillations to higher global coupling values in the model. Thus, in contrast to the asynchronous {fMRI} state, delays are important to consider in the presence of oscillation. © 2013.},

            Epilepsy presurgical investigation may include focal intracortical single-pulse electrical stimulations with depth electrodes, which induce cortico-cortical evoked potentials at distant sites because of white matter connectivity. Cortico-cortical evoked potentials provide a unique window on functional brain networks because they contain sufficient information to infer dynamical properties of large-scale brain connectivity, such as preferred directionality and propagation latencies.
             Here, we developed a biologically informed modelling approach to estimate the neural physiological parameters of brain functional networks from the cortico-cortical evoked potentials recorded in a large multicentric database. Specifically, we considered each cortico-cortical evoked potential as the output of a transient stimulus entering the stimulated region, which directly propagated to the recording region. Both regions were modelled as coupled neural mass models, the parameters of which were estimated from the first cortico-cortical evoked potential component, occurring before 80 ms, using dynamic causal modelling and Bayesian model inversion. This methodology was applied to the data of 780 patients with epilepsy from the F-{TRACT} database, providing a total of 34 354 bipolar stimulations and 774 445 cortico-cortical evoked potentials. The cortical mapping of the local excitatory and inhibitory synaptic time constants and of the axonal conduction delays between cortical regions was obtained at the population level using anatomy-based averaging procedures, based on the Lausanne2008 and the {HCP}-{MMP}1 parcellation schemes, containing 130 and 360 parcels, respectively. To rule out brain maturation effects, a separate analysis was performed for older (\&gt;15 years) and younger patients (\&lt;15 years). In the group of older subjects, we found that the cortico-cortical axonal conduction delays between parcels were globally short (median = 10.2 ms) and only 16\% were larger than 20 ms. This was associated to a median velocity of 3.9 m/s. Although a general lengthening of these delays with the distance between the stimulating and recording contacts was observed across the cortex, some regions were less affected by this rule, such as the insula for which almost all efferent and afferent connections were faster than 10 ms. Synaptic time constants were found to be shorter in the sensorimotor, medial occipital and latero-temporal regions, than in other cortical areas. Finally, we found that axonal conduction delays were significantly larger in the group of subjects younger than 15 years, which corroborates that brain maturation increases the speed of brain dynamics.
            To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide a local estimation of axonal conduction delays and synaptic time constants across the whole human cortex in vivo, based on intracerebral electrophysiological recordings.},

	abstract = {Both biophysical and neurophysiological aspects need to be considered to assess the impact of electric fields induced by transcranial current stimulation ({tCS}) on the cerebral cortex and the subsequent effects occurring on scalp {EEG}. The objective of this work was to elaborate a global model allowing for the simulation of scalp {EEG} signals under {tCS}. In our integrated modeling approach, realistic meshes of the head tissues and of the stimulation electrodes were first built to map the generated electric field distribution on the cortical surface. Secondly, source activities at various cortical macro-regions were generated by means of a computational model of neuronal populations. The model parameters were adjusted so that populations generated an oscillating activity around 10 Hz resembling typical {EEG} alpha activity. In order to account for {tCS} effects and following current biophysical models, the calculated component of the electric field normal to the cortex was used to locally influence the activity of neuronal populations. Lastly, {EEG} under both spontaneous and {tACS}-stimulated (transcranial sinunoidal {tCS} from 4 to 16 Hz) brain activity was simulated at the level of scalp electrodes by solving the forward problem in the aforementioned realistic head model. Under the 10 Hz-{tACS} condition, a significant increase in alpha power occurred in simulated scalp {EEG} signals as compared to the no-stimulation condition. This increase involved most channels bilaterally, was more pronounced on posterior electrodes and was only significant for {tACS} frequencies from 8 to 12 Hz. The immediate effects of {tACS} in the model agreed with the post-{tACS} results previously reported in real subjects. Moreover, additional information was also brought by the model at other electrode positions or stimulation frequency. This suggests that our modeling approach can be used to compare, interpret and predict changes occurring on {EEG} with respect to parameters used in specific stimulation configurations.},

	abstract = {Non-invasive electrical stimulation of the human cortex by means of transcranial direct current stimulation ({tDCS}) has been instrumental in a number of important discoveries in the field of human cortical function and has become a well-established method for evaluating brain function in healthy human participants. Recently, transcranial alternating current stimulation ({tACS}) has been introduced to directly modulate the ongoing rhythmic brain activity by the application of oscillatory currents on the human scalp. Until now the efficiency of {tACS} in modulating rhythmic brain activity has been indicated only by inference from perceptual and behavioural consequences of electrical stimulation. No direct electrophysiological evidence of {tACS} has been reported. We delivered {tACS} over the occipital cortex of 10 healthy participants to entrain the neuronal oscillatory activity in their individual alpha frequency range and compared results with those from a separate group of participants receiving sham stimulation. The {tACS} but not the sham stimulation elevated the endogenous alpha power in parieto-central electrodes of the electroencephalogram. Additionally, in a network of spiking neurons, we simulated how {tACS} can be affected even after the end of stimulation. The results show that spike-timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP}) selectively modulates synapses depending on the resonance frequencies of the neural circuits that they belong to. Thus, {tACS} influences {STDP} which in turn results in aftereffects upon neural activity. The present findings are the first direct electrophysiological evidence of an interaction of {tACS} and ongoing oscillatory activity in the human cortex. The data demonstrate the ability of {tACS} to specifically modulate oscillatory brain activity and show its potential both at fostering knowledge on the functional significance of brain oscillations and for therapeutic application.},

	abstract = {Phase amplitude coupling ({PAC}) between slow and fast oscillations is found throughout the brain and plays important functional roles. Its neural origin remains unclear. Experimental findings are often puzzling and sometimes contradictory. Most computational models rely on pairs of pacemaker neurons or neural populations tuned at different frequencies to produce {PAC}. Here, using a data-driven model of a hippocampal microcircuit, we demonstrate that {PAC} can naturally emerge from a single feedback mechanism involving an inhibitory and excitatory neuron population, which interplay to generate theta frequency periodic bursts of higher frequency gamma. The model suggests the conditions under which a {CA}1 microcircuit can operate to elicit theta-gamma {PAC}, and highlights the modulatory role of {OLM} and {PVBC} cells, recurrent connectivity, and short term synaptic plasticity. Surprisingly, the results suggest the experimentally testable prediction that the generation of the slow population oscillation requires the fast one and cannot occur without it.},

	abstract = {Phase amplitude coupling’ ({PAC}) in oscillatory neural activity describes a phenomenon whereby the amplitude of higher frequency activity is modulated by the phase of lower frequency activity. Such coupled oscillatory activity – also referred to as ‘cross-frequency coupling’ or ‘nested rhythms’ – has been shown to occur in a number of brain regions and at behaviorally relevant time points during cognitive tasks; this suggests functional relevance, but the circuit mechanisms of {PAC} generation remain unclear. In this paper we present a model of a canonical circuit for generating {PAC} activity, showing how interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neural populations can be periodically shifted in to and out of oscillatory firing patterns by afferent drive, hence generating higher frequency oscillations phase-locked to a lower frequency, oscillating input signal. Since many brain regions contain mutually connected excitatory-inhibitory populations receiving oscillatory input, the simplicity of the mechanism generating {PAC} in such networks may explain the ubiquity of {PAC} across diverse neural systems and behaviors. Analytic treatment of this circuit as a nonlinear dynamical system demonstrates how connection strengths and inputs to the populations can be varied in order to change the extent and nature of {PAC} activity, importantly which phase of the lower frequency rhythm the higher frequency activity is locked to. Consequently, this model can inform attempts to associate distinct types of {PAC} with different network topologies and physiologies in real data.},

However, to deal with increasing amounts of data, we need “machine scientists” that are able to extract these models automatically from data. Here, we introduce a Bayesian machine scientist, which establishes the plausibility of models using explicit approximations to the exact marginal posterior over models and establishes its prior expectations about models by learning from a large empirical corpus of mathematical expressions. It explores the space of models using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We show that this approach uncovers accurate models for synthetic and real data and provides out-of-sample predictions that are more accurate than those of existing approaches and of other nonparametric methods.},

	abstract = {Working memory ({WM}) is the active retention and processing of information over a few seconds and is considered an essential component of cognitive function. The reduced {WM} capacity is a common feature in many diseases, such as schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}), mild cognitive impairment ({MCI}), and Alzheimer's disease ({AD}). The theta-gamma neural code is an essential component of memory representations in the multi-item {WM}. A large body of studies have examined the association between cross-frequency coupling ({CFC}) across the cerebral cortices and {WM} performance; electrophysiological data together with the behavioral results showed the associations between {CFC} and {WM} performance. The oscillatory entrainment (sensory, non-invasive electrical/magnetic, and invasive electrical) remains the key method to investigate the causal relationship between {CFC} and {WM}. The frequency-tuned non-invasive brain stimulation is a promising way to improve {WM} performance in healthy and non-healthy patients with cognitive impairment. The {WM} performance is sensitive to the phase and rhythm of externally applied stimulations. {CFC}-transcranial-alternating current stimulation ({CFC}-{tACS}) is a recent approach in neuroscience that could alter cognitive outcomes. The studies that investigated (1) the association between {CFC} and {WM} and (2) the brain stimulation protocols that enhanced {WM} through modulating {CFC} by the means of the non-invasive brain stimulation techniques have been included in this review. In principle, this review can guide the researchers to identify the most prominent form of {CFC} associated with {WM} processing (e.g., theta/gamma phase-amplitude coupling), and to define the previously published studies that manipulate endogenous {CFC} externally to improve {WM}. This in turn will pave the path for future studies aimed at investigating the {CFC}-{tACS} effect on {WM}. The {CFC}-{tACS} protocols need to be thoroughly studied before they can be considered as therapeutic tools in patients with {WM} deficits.},

We developed a data-driven, supercomputer-based, full-scale (1:1) model of the rodent {CA}1 area and studied its interneurons during theta oscillations. Theta rhythm with phase-locked gamma oscillations and phase-preferential discharges of distinct interneuronal types spontaneously emerged from the isolated {CA}1 circuit without rhythmic inputs. Perturbation experiments identified parvalbumin-expressing interneurons and neurogliaform cells, as well as interneuronal diversity itself, as important factors in theta generation. These simulations reveal new insights into the spatiotemporal organization of the {CA}1 circuit during theta oscillations.},

	abstract = {Synchronous rhythmic spiking in neuronal networks can be brought about by the interaction between E-cells and Icells (excitatory and inhibitory cells). The I-cells gate and synchronize the E-cells, and the E-cells drive and synchronize the I-cells. We refer to rhythms generated in this way as {PING} (pyramidal-interneuronal gamma) rhythms. The {PING} mechanism requires that the drive I
              I
              to the I-cells be sufficiently low; the rhythm is lost when I
              I
              gets too large. This can happen in at least two ways. In the first mechanism, the I-cells spike in synchrony, but get ahead of the E-cells, spiking without being prompted by the E-cells. We call this phase walkthrough of the I-cells. In the second mechanism, the I-cells fail to synchronize, and their activity leads to complete suppression of the E-cells. Noisy spiking in the E-cells, generated by noisy external drive, adds excitatory drive to the I-cells and may lead to phase walkthrough. Noisy spiking in the I-cells adds inhibition to the E-cells and may lead to suppression of the E-cells. An analysis of the conditions under which noise leads to phase walkthrough of the I-cells or suppression of the E-cells shows that {PING} rhythms at frequencies far below the gamma range are robust to noise only if network parameter values are tuned very carefully. Together with an argument explaining why the {PING} mechanism does not work far above the gamma range in the presence of heterogeneity, this justifies the “G” in “{PING}.”},

These neural sequences result from the integration of both external inputs conveying sensory-motor information, and intrinsic network dynamics possibly related to memory processes. Their endogenous replay during subsequent sleep is critical for memory consolidation. The present review discusses possible mechanisms and functions of hippocampal theta sequences during exploration. We present several lines of evidence suggesting that these neural sequences play a key role in information processing and support the formation of initial memory traces, and discuss potential functional distinctions between neural sequences emerging during theta vs. awake sharp-wave ripples.},

	abstract = {Cross-frequency coupling ({CFC}) has been suggested to constitute a highly ﬂexible mechanism for cortical information gating and processing, giving rise to conscious perception and various higher cognitive functions in humans. In particular, it might provide an elegant tool for information integration across several spatiotemporal scales within nested or coupled neuronal networks. However, it is currently unknown whether low-frequency (theta/alpha) or high-frequency gamma oscillations orchestrate cross-frequency interactions, raising the question of who is master and who is slave. While correlative evidence suggested that at least two distinct {CFC} modes exist, namely, phase-amplitude-coupling ({PAC}) and amplitude-envelope correlations ({AEC}), it is currently unknown whether they subserve distinct cortical functions. Novel non-invasive brain stimulation tools, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation ({tACS}), now provide the unique opportunity to selectively entrain the low- or high-frequency component and study subsequent effects on {CFC}. Here, we demonstrate the differential modulation of {CFC} during selective entrainment of alpha or gamma oscillations. Our results reveal that entrainment of the low-frequency component increased {PAC}, where gamma power became preferentially locked to the trough of the alpha oscillation, while gamma-band entrainment enhanced {AECs} and reduced alpha power. These results provide causal evidence for the functional role of coupled alpha and gamma oscillations for visual processing.},

This would allow entorhinal input to play a role in both retrieval and encoding without engaging long-term potentiation ({LTP}) during retrieval. Experiments in brain slice preparations of the hippocampal formation tested the relationship between rhythmic input to s. lacunosum-moleculare and the time of maximal {LTP} induction at Schaffer collateral synapses in s. radiatum. Analysis of the data demonstrates a statistically significant difference in the induction of {LTP} for different time intervals between the end of each four-pulse train in s. lacunosum-moleculare and the single pulse s. radiatum stimulation.

Using a wavelet-based analysis, we investigated how power changes and phase clustering in different frequency bands contribute to the averaged event-related potentials ({ERPs}). In addition, we analyzed the actual mean phases of the different oscillations. Our analyses yielded the following results: (1) power changes contributed signiﬁcantly only to the late components of the {ERPs} ({\textgreater}400 ms) (2) earlier {ERP} components were produced by a stimulus-related broadband phase and amplitude reset of ongoing oscillatory activity about 190 ms after stimulus onset that involved not only the theta band, but also covered alpha and lower beta band frequencies (3) phase and amplitude reset occurred during an epoch of increased phase entrainment over time that lasted for about two oscillation periods for all involved frequencies and was more pronounced for correct rejections than for hits. The broad-band phase and amplitude reset was observed for both hits and correct rejections, and therefore, did not appear to support a speciﬁc cognitive function, but rather to act as a general facilitating factor for the processes involved in this memory task. Further analyses of synchronization between oscillations and power changes in different frequency bands revealed a task-dependent modulation of gamma activity by the entrained theta cycle, a mechanism potentially related to memory encoding and retrieval in the rhinal cortex and hippocampus, respectively. {VC} 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Many theories of hippocampal function assume that area {CA}3 of hippocampus is capable of performing rapid pattern storage, as well as pattern completion when a partial version of a familiar pattern is presented, and that the dentate gyrus ({DG}) is a preprocessor that performs pattern separation, facilitating storage and recall in {CA}3. The latter assumption derives partly from the anatomical and physiological properties of {DG}. However, the major output of {DG} is from a large number of {DG} granule cells to a smaller number of {CA}3 pyramidal cells, which potentially negates the pattern separation performed in the {DG}. Here, we consider a simple {CA}3 network model, and consider how it might interact with a previously developed computational model of the {DG}. The resulting ‘‘standard’’ {DG}-{CA}3 model performs pattern storage and completion well, given a small set of sparse, randomly derived patterns representing entorhinal input to the {DG} and {CA}3. However, under many circumstances, the pattern separation achieved in the {DG} is not as robust in {CA}3, resulting in a low storage capacity for {CA}3, compared to previous mathematical estimates of the storage capacity for an autoassociative network of this size. We also examine an oftenoverlooked aspect of hippocampal anatomy that might increase functionality in the combined {DG}-{CA}3 model. Speciﬁcally, axon collaterals of {CA}3 pyramidal cells project ‘‘back’’ to the {DG} (‘‘backprojections’’), exerting inhibitory effects on granule cells that could potentially ensure that different subpopulations of granule cells are recruited to respond to similar patterns. In the model, addition of such backprojections improves both pattern separation and storage capacity. We also show that the {DG}-{CA}3 model with backprojections provides a better ﬁt to empirical data than a model without backprojections. Therefore, we hypothesize that {CA}3 backprojections might play an important role in hippocampal function. {VC} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Temporal lobe epilepsy ({TLE}) is a common type of epilepsy with hippocampus as the usual site of origin. The {CA}3 subﬁeld of hippocampus is reported to have a low epileptic threshold and hence initiates the disorder in patients with {TLE}. This study computationally investigates how impaired dendritic inhibition of pyramidal cells in the vulnerable {CA}3 subﬁeld leads to generation of epileptic activity. A model of {CA}3 subﬁeld consisting of 800 pyramidal cells, 200 basket cells ({BC}) and 200 Oriens—Lacunosum Moleculare (O-{LM}) interneurons was used. The dendritic inhibition provided by O-{LM} interneurons is reported to be selectively impaired in some {TLEs}. A step-wise approach is taken to investigate how alterations in network connectivity lead to generation of epileptic patterns. Initially, dendritic inhibition alone was reduced, followed by an increase in the external inputs received at the distal dendrites of pyramidal cells, and ﬁnally additional changes were made at the synapses between all neurons in the network. In the ﬁrst case, when the dendritic inhibition of pyramidal cells alone was reduced, the local ﬁeld potential activity changed from a thetamodulated gamma pattern to a prominently gamma frequency pattern. In the second case, in addition to this reduction of dendritic inhibition, with a simultaneous large increase in the external excitatory inputs received by pyramidal cells, the basket cells entered a state of depolarization block, causing the network to generate a typical ictal activity pattern. In the third case, when the dendritic inhibition onto the pyramidal cells was reduced and changes were simultaneously made in synaptic connectivity between all neurons in the network, the basket cells were again observed to enter depolarization block. In the third case, impairment of dendritic inhibition required to generate an ictal activity pattern was lesser than the two previous cases. Moreover, the ictal like activity began earlier in the third case. Hence, our study suggests that greater synaptic plasticity occurring in the whole network due to increase in reception of external excitatory inputs (due to impaired dendritic inhibition) makes the network more susceptible to generation of epileptic activity. {VC} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Phase-amplitude coupling between theta and multiple gamma sub-bands is a hallmark of hippocampal activity and believed to take part in information routing. More recently, theta and gamma oscillations were also reported to exhibit phase-phase coupling, or n:m phase-locking, suggesting an important mechanism of neuronal coding that has long received theoretical support. However, by analyzing simulated and actual {LFPs}, here we question the existence of theta-gamma phase-phase coupling in the rat hippocampus. We show that the quasi-linear phase shifts introduced by filtering lead to spurious coupling levels in both white noise and hippocampal {LFPs}, which highly depend on epoch length, and that significant coupling may be falsely detected when employing improper surrogate methods. We also show that waveform asymmetry and frequency harmonics may generate artifactual n:m phase-locking. Studies investigating phase-phase coupling should rely on appropriate statistical controls and be aware of confounding factors; otherwise, they could easily fall into analysis pitfalls.
          , 
            Neuroscientists have long sought to understand how the brain works by analyzing its electrical activity. Placing electrodes on the scalp or lowering them into the brain itself reveals rhythmic waves of activity known as oscillations. These arise when large numbers of neurons fire in synchrony. Recordings reveal that the frequency of these oscillations – the number of cycles of a wave per second, measured in Hertz – can vary between brain regions, and within a single region over time. Moreover, oscillations with different frequencies can co-exist and interact with one another.
            Within the hippocampus, an area of the brain involved in memory, two types of oscillations dominate: theta waves and gamma waves. Theta waves are relatively slow waves, with a frequency between 5 and 10 Hertz. Gamma waves are faster, with a frequency of up to 100 Hertz. Recent work has suggested that gamma waves and theta waves show a phenomenon called phase-phase coupling. Since gamma waves are faster than theta waves, multiple cycles of gamma can occur during a single cycle of theta. Phase-phase coupling is the idea that gamma and theta waves align themselves, such that gamma waves always begin at the same relative position within a theta wave. This was thought to help the hippocampus to encode memories.
            Using computer simulations and recordings from the rat hippocampus, Scheffer-Teixeira and Tort have now reexamined the evidence for theta-gamma phase-phase coupling. The new results suggest that previous reports describing the phenomenon may have relied on inadequate statistical techniques. Using stringent control analyses, Scheffer-Teixeira and Tort find no evidence for prominent theta-gamma phase-phase coupling in the hippocampus. Instead, the simulations suggest that what appeared to be statistically significant coupling may in reality be an artifact of the previous analysis.
            Phase-phase coupling of theta and gamma waves has also been reported in the human hippocampus. The next step therefore is to apply these more robust analysis techniques to data from the human brain. While revisiting previously accepted findings may not always be popular, it will likely be essential if neuroscientists want to accurately understand how new memories are formed.},

	abstract = {Assessing the behavioral relevance of the hippocampal theta rhythm has proven difficult, due to a shortage of experiments that selectively manipulate phase-specific information processing. Using closed-loop stimulation, we triggered inhibition of dorsal {CA}1 at specific phases of the endogenous theta rhythm in freely behaving mice. This intervention enhanced performance on a spatial navigation task that requires the encoding and retrieval of information related to reward location on every trial. In agreement with prior models of hippocampal function, the behavioral effects depended on both the phase of theta and the task segment at which we stimulated. Stimulation in the encoding segment enhanced performance when inhibition was triggered by the peak of theta. Conversely, stimulation in the retrieval segment enhanced performance when inhibition was triggered by the trough of theta. These results suggest that processes related to the encoding and retrieval of task-relevant information are preferentially active at distinct phases of theta.
          , 
            Around 15 years ago, an imaging study compared the brains of London taxi drivers—who need to know their way around one of the biggest cities in the world—with those of the general public, and found that a structure called the hippocampus was routinely larger in the taxi drivers. This finding was consistent with previous studies from rats, which showed that anatomical changes occur in the hippocampus after animals learn to navigate through various mazes. Together, these results suggest that the hippocampus is important for spatial awareness in both humans and rodents.
            The hippocampus—which takes its name from the Greek for ‘seahorse’ due to its shape—consists mostly of cells called pyramidal neurons, which communicate with one other using an excitatory molecule called glutamate. However, it also contains cells that suppress the activity of the pyramidal neurons, using an inhibitory molecule called {GABA}. When electrodes are used to record the combined electrical activity of many cells in the hippocampus—including both excitatory and inhibitory cells—the resulting pattern resembles a wave with peaks and troughs that repeat roughly eight times per second. Although this activity, known as the theta rhythm or cycle, has been observed in countless experiments, it has been difficult to pin down how it is relevant to behavior.
            Siegle and Wilson now show that the theta cycle may help the brain to keep incoming information separate from information stored in memory. This conclusion is based on the results of experiments on mice with hippocampi that had been modified to make them sensitive to light: in particular, light was needed to activate the neurons that suppress the activity of the pyramidal neurons. This meant that it was possible to reduce the overall level of activity in the hippocampus by shining light on certain neurons.
            The mice were trained to perform a spatial memory task that consisted of an encoding stage—where they learned the location of a reward—and a retrieval stage, in which they recalled this location from memory. On certain trials, pulses of light could be delivered to the brain at specific points in the theta cycle. Delivering light near the peak of the cycle during the encoding stage resulted in improved memory performance, as did delivering light near the trough of the cycle during the retrieval stage.
            These results suggest that the hippocampus preferentially encodes and retrieves information at different stages of the theta cycle. Specifically, activity just after the peak of the theta cycle is biased towards retrieval, meaning that reducing hippocampal activity at this time point will make it easier to form new memories. By contrast, reducing activity just after the trough of the theta cycle—when the hippocampus is biased towards encoding—will enhance memory retrieval.},

Two primary neuronal coupling modes have been described: phase-coupling and amplitude-coupling. Theoretically, both coupling modes are independent, but so far, their neuronal relationship remains unclear. Here, we combined {MEG}, source-reconstruction and simulations to systematically compare cortical amplitude-coupling and phase-coupling patterns in the human brain. Importantly, we took into account a critical bias of amplitudecoupling measures due to phase-coupling. We found differences between both coupling modes across a broad frequency range and most of the cortex. Furthermore, by combining empirical measurements and simulations we ruled out that these results were caused by methodological biases, but instead reﬂected genuine neuronal amplitude coupling. Our results show that cortical phase- and amplitude-coupling patterns are non-redundant, which may reﬂect at least partly distinct neuronal mechanisms. Furthermore, our ﬁndings highlight and clarify the compound nature of amplitude coupling measures.},

Many possible mechanisms have been described through which γ oscillations could act on cortical circuits to modulate their responses to input, alter their patterns of activity, and/or enhance the efficacy of their outputs onto downstream targets. Recently, several studies have observed changes in behavior after optogenetically manipulating neocortical γ oscillations. Now, future studies should determine whether these manipulations elicit physiological correlates associated with specific mechanisms through which γ oscillations are hypothesized to modulate cortical circuit function. There are numerous such mechanisms, so identifying which ones are actually engaged by optogenetic manipulations known to affect behavior would help flesh out exactly how γ oscillations contribute to cortical circuit function under normal and/or pathological conditions.},

There has been particular interest in the modulation of the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations by the phase of low-frequency oscillations, since recent evidence suggests a functional role for this type of cross-frequency coupling ({CFC}). Phase-amplitude coupling has been reported in continuous electrophysiological signals obtained from the brain at both local and macroscopic levels. In the present work, we present a new measure for assessing phase-amplitude {CFC}. This measure is defined as an adaptation of the Kullback–Leibler distance—a function that is used to infer the distance between two distributions—and calculates how much an empirical amplitude distribution-like function over phase bins deviates from the uniform distribution. We show that a {CFC} measure defined this way is well suited for assessing the intensity of phase-amplitude coupling. We also review seven other {CFC} measures; we show that, by some performance benchmarks, our measure is especially attractive for this task. We also discuss some technical aspects related to the measure, such as the length of the epochs used for these analyses and the utility of surrogate control analyses. Finally, we apply the measure and a related {CFC} tool to actual hippocampal recordings obtained from freely moving rats and show, for the first time, that the {CA}3 and {CA}1 regions present different {CFC} characteristics.},

Methods: We provide a short introduction to resting state {fMRI} and discuss multiple currently accepted resting state networks with a review of the literature.
Results: We review the characteristics and function of multiple somatosensory, association, and other networks. We discuss the concept of critical nodes in the brain and how the neurosurgeon can use this information to individually customize patient care.
Conclusion: Although further research is necessary, future application of pre-surgical planning will require consideration of networks other than just motor and language in order to minimize post-surgical morbidity and customize patient care.},

In this study, we applied an {IAF}-{tACS} protocol over parieto-occipital areas to a sample of healthy subjects and measured its effects over the power spectra. Additionally, we used computational models to get a deeper understanding of the results observed in the experiment. Both experimental and numerical results showed an increase in alpha power of 8.02\% with respect to the sham condition in a widespread set of regions in the cortex, excluding some expected parietal regions. This result could be partially explained by taking into account the orientation of the electric field with respect to the columnar structures of the cortex, showing that the gyrification in parietal regions could generate effects in opposite directions (hyper-/depolarization) at the same time in specific brain regions. Additionally, we used a network model of spiking neuronal populations to explore the effects that these opposite polarities could have on neural activity, and we found that the best predictor of alpha power was the average of the normal components of the electric field. To sum up, our study sheds light on the mechanisms underlying {tACS} brain activity modulation, using both empirical and computational approaches. Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques hold promise for treating brain disorders, but further research is needed to fully understand and control their effects on brain dynamics and cognition. Our findings contribute to this growing body of research and provide a foundation for future studies aimed at optimizing the use of non-invasive brain stimulation in clinical settings.},

	abstract = {The cingulum bundle is a prominent white matter tract that interconnects frontal, parietal, and medial temporal sites, while also linking subcortical nuclei to the cingulate gyrus. Despite its apparent continuity, the cingulum's composition continually changes as fibres join and leave the bundle. To help understand its complex structure, this review begins with detailed, comparative descriptions of the multiple connections comprising the cingulum bundle. Next, the impact of cingulum bundle damage in rats, monkeys, and humans is analysed. Despite causing extensive anatomical disconnections, cingulum bundle lesions typically produce only mild deficits, highlighting the importance of parallel pathways and the distributed nature of its various functions. Meanwhile, non-invasive imaging implicates the cingulum bundle in executive control, emotion, pain (dorsal cingulum), and episodic memory (parahippocampal cingulum), while clinical studies reveal cingulum abnormalities in numerous conditions, including schizophrenia, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Alzheimer's disease. Understanding the seemingly diverse contributions of the cingulum will require better ways of isolating pathways within this highly complex tract.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the basic mechanisms of rhythmicity using the models of neuronal populations. The models presented in the chapter allows to understand the neural mechanisms underlying certain types of field potentials revealed in the {EEG}, particularly the generation of alpha or theta rhythms and of epileptic paroxysms. The importance of this aspect to general neurophysiology may be secondary, however, considering the fact that the field potential does not form an essential element of the activity of neuron populations. However, it is very relevant in view of the paramount importance of the {EEG} in clinical neurophysiology. In this respect, it should be noted that the {EEG} is still the neurophysiological signal most widely employed to evaluate normal and pathological human brain activity. The models of alpha and theta rhythms presented in the chapter should not be considered as the models of the {EEG}. They may well be relevant only for particular aspects of {EEG} signals; the {EEG} as recorded from the scalp includes a variety of phenomena about which sufficient basic information is yet not available An exception may be the case of paroxysmal activity characteristic of epileptic foci. The chapter also presents models that include excitatory and inhibitory feedback.},

	abstract = {Spatiotemporal pattern formation in neuronal networks depends on the interplay between cellular and network synchronization properties. The neuronal phase response curve ({PRC}) is an experimentally obtainable measure that characterizes the cellular response to small perturbations, and can serve as an indicator of cellular propensity for synchronization. Two broad classes of {PRCs} have been identified for neurons: Type I, in which small excitatory perturbations induce only advances in firing, and Type {II}, in which small excitatory perturbations can induce both advances and delays in firing. Interestingly, neuronal {PRCs} are usually attenuated with increased spiking frequency, and Type {II} {PRCs} typically exhibit a greater attenuation of the phase delay region than of the phase advance region. We found that this phenomenon arises from an interplay between the time constants of active ionic currents and the interspike interval. As a result, excitatory networks consisting of neurons with Type I {PRCs} responded very differently to frequency modulation compared to excitatory networks composed of neurons with Type {II} {PRCs}. Specifically, increased frequency induced a sharp decrease in synchrony of networks of Type {II} neurons, while frequency increases only minimally affected synchrony in networks of Type I neurons. These results are demonstrated in networks in which both types of neurons were modeled generically with the Morris-Lecar model, as well as in networks consisting of Hodgkin-Huxley-based model cortical pyramidal cells in which simulated effects of acetylcholine changed {PRC} type. These results are robust to different network structures, synaptic strengths and modes of driving neuronal activity, and they indicate that Type I and Type {II} excitatory networks may display two distinct modes of processing information.},

Network neuroscience proposes to tackle these enduring challenges.

Two parallel trends drive the approach: the availability of new empirical tools to create comprehensive maps and record dynamic patterns among molecules, neurons, brain areas and social systems; and the theoretical framework and computational tools of modern network science. The convergence of empirical and computational advances opens new frontiers of scientific inquiry, including network dynamics, manipulation and control of brain networks, and integration of network processes across spatiotemporal domains. We review emerging trends in network neuroscience and attempt to chart a path toward a better understanding of the brain as a multiscale networked system.},

	abstract = {Connectivity between neural regions, particularly in the hippocampus, is seldom all-to-all or random, yet it is the predominant method by which connectivity is implemented in most models of neuronal networks. We have been developing a computational platform for simulating the trisynaptic circuit of rat hippocampus with which we have constructed a large-scale, biologically-realistic, spiking neuronal network model of the entorhinal-dentate-{CA}3 system. Using the model, we had demonstrated a non-trivial effect of topographic connectivity on network dynamics and function. In this work, we detail the introduction of the {CA}1 subregion to the large-scale model. Using anatomical data, we constrained the distribution of axon collaterals, i.e., Schaffer collaterals, projected from {CA}3 to {CA}1 and preserved the topographic organization of the projections. Using a simplified multicompartmental model of {CA}1 pyramidal cells and a single compartment model of {CA}1 parvalbumin basket cells, that were connected with disynaptic feedforward inhibition and feedback inhibition, we demonstrate the network activity of the {CA}1 network given a topographic organization of Schaffer collaterals. From this introduction of {CA}1 to the large-scale model, we can then observe the successive transformation of spatio-temporal, spiking neural activity as it propagates through the trisynaptic circuit.},

	abstract = {Many real-world systems are often regarded as weakly coupled limit-cycle oscillators, in which each oscillator corresponds to a dynamical system with many degrees of freedom that have collective oscillations. One of the most practical methods for investigating the synchronization properties of such a rhythmic system is to statistically extract phase coupling functions between limit-cycle oscillators directly from observed time-series data. In Particular, using a method that combines phase reduction theory and Bayesian inference, the phase coupling functions can be extracted from the time-series data of even just one variable in each oscillatory dynamical system with many degrees of freedom. However, it remains unclear how the choice of the observed variables affects the statistical inference for the phase coupling functions. In this study, we examine the influence of observed variable types on the extraction of phase coupling functions using some typical dynamical elements under various conditions. We demonstrate that our method can consistently extract the macroscopic phase coupling functions between two phases representing collective oscillations in a fully locked state, regardless of the observed variable types; for example, even using one variable of any element in one system and the mean-field value over all the elements in another system. We also study the case of globally coupled phase oscillators in a partially locked state. Our results reveal directional asymmetry in the robustness of extracting the macroscopic phase coupling function between two networks. For instance, when an asynchronous oscillator in network \$A\$ and the macroscopic collective oscillation of network \$B\$ is observed, the macroscopic phase coupling function from network \$A\$ to network \$B\$ can be extracted more robustly than in the opposite direction.},

	abstract = {Large amounts of multimodal neuroimaging data are acquired every year worldwide. In order to extract high-dimensional information for computational neuroscience applications standardized data fusion and efficient reduction into integrative data structures are required. Such self-consistent multimodal data sets can be used for computational brain modeling to constrain models with individual measurable features of the brain, such as done with The Virtual Brain ({TVB}). {TVB} is a simulation platform that uses empirical structural and functional data to build full brain models of individual humans. For convenient model construction, we developed a processing pipeline for structural, functional and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) and optionally electroencephalography ({EEG}) data. The pipeline combines several state-of-the-art neuroinformatics tools to generate subject-specific cortical and subcortical parcellations, surface-tessellations, structural and functional connectomes, lead field matrices, electrical source activity estimates and region-wise aggregated blood oxygen level dependent ({BOLD}) functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) time-series. The output files of the pipeline can be directly uploaded to {TVB} to create and simulate individualized large-scale network models that incorporate intra- and intercortical interaction on the basis of cortical surface triangulations and white matter tractograpy. We detail the pitfalls of the individual processing streams and discuss ways of validation. With the pipeline we also introduce novel ways of estimating the transmission strengths of fiber tracts in whole-brain structural connectivity ({SC}) networks and compare the outcomes of different tractography or parcellation approaches. We tested the functionality of the pipeline on 50 multimodal data sets. In order to quantify the robustness of the connectome extraction part of the pipeline we computed several metrics that quantify its rescan reliability and compared them to other tractography approaches. Together with the pipeline we present several principles to guide future efforts to standardize brain model construction. The code of the pipeline and the fully processed data sets are made available to the public via The Virtual Brain website (thevirtualbrain.org) and via github (. https://github.com/{BrainModes}/{TVB}-empirical-data-pipeline). Furthermore, the pipeline can be directly used with High Performance Computing ({HPC}) resources on the Neuroscience Gateway Portal (. http://www.nsgportal.org) through a convenient web-interface.},

However, much less is known about how these canonical disinhibitory circuit motifs contribute to network operations supporting spatial navigation and learning in the hippocampus. Using chronic two-photon calcium imaging in mice performing random foraging or goal-oriented learning tasks, we found that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-expressing ({VIP} + ), disinhibitory {INs} in hippocampal area {CA}1 form functional subpopulations defined by their modulation by behavioral states and task demands. Optogenetic manipulations of {VIP} + {INs} and computational modeling further showed that {VIP} + disinhibition is necessary for goal-directed learning and related reorganization of hippocampal pyramidal cell population dynamics. Our results demonstrate that disinhibitory circuits in the hippocampus play an active role in supporting spatial learning. Video Abstract: Turi et al. imaged activity of {VIP}-expressing interneurons of hippocampal area {CA}1 in vivo. They show learning-related reorganization in {VIP} population dynamics. {VIP} interneurons provide behavioral state-dependent disinhibition for {CA}1 pyramidal cells that supports spatial reward learning.},

Nonetheless, there is a lack of studies about how functional connectivity patterns may distinguish between progressive ({pMCI}) and stable ({sMCI}) {MCI} patients. To examine whether there were differences in functional connectivity between groups, {MEG} eyes-closed recordings from 30 {sMCI} and 19 {pMCI} subjects were compared. The average conversion time of {pMCI} was 1 year, so they were considered as fast converters. To this end, functional connectivity in different frequency bands was assessed with phase locking value in source space. Then the significant differences between both groups were correlated with neuropsychological scores and entorhinal, parahippocampal, and hippocampal volumes. Both groups did not differ in age, gender, or educational level. {pMCI} patients obtained lower scores in episodic and semantic memory and also in executive functioning. At the structural level, there were no differences in hippocampal volume, although some were found in left entorhinal volume between both groups. Additionally, {pMCI} patients exhibit a higher synchronization in the alpha band between the right anterior cingulate and temporo-occipital regions than {sMCI} subjects. This hypersynchronization was inversely correlated with cognitive performance, both hippocampal volumes, and left entorhinal volume. The increase in phase synchronization between the right anterior cingulate and temporo-occipital areas may be predictive of conversion from {MCI} to {AD}.},

The binding of features, or the association of computations occurring in spatially segregated areas, is supposed to take place when a stable synchronization between cortical areas occurs. While a direct cortico-cortical connection typically fails to support this mechanism, the participation of a third area, a relay element, mediating in the communication was proposed to overcome this limitation. Among the different structures that could play the role of coordination during the binding process, the thalamus is the best placed region to carry out this task. In this paper we study how information flows in a canonical motif that mimics a cortico-thalamo-cortical circuit composed by three mutually coupled neuronal populations (also called the V-motif). Through extensive numerical simulations, we found that the amount of information transferred between the oscillating neuronal populations is determined by the delay in their connections and the mismatch in their oscillation frequencies (detuning). While the transmission from a cortical population is mostly restricted to positive detuning, transmission from the relay (thalamic) population to the cortical populations is robust for a broad range of detuning values, including negative values, while permitting feedback communication from the cortex at high frequencies, thus supporting robust bottom up and top down interaction. In this case, a strong feedback transmission between the cortex to thalamus supports the possibility of robust bottom-up and top-down interactions in this motif. Interestingly, adding a cortico-cortical bidirectional connection to the V-motif (C-motif) expands the dynamics of the system with distinct operation modes. While overall transmission efficiency is decreased, new communication channels establish cortico-thalamo-cortical association loops. Switching between operation modes depends on the synaptic strength of the cortico-cortical connections. Our results support a role of the transthalamic V-motif in the binding of spatially segregated cortical computations, and suggest an important regulatory role of the direct cortico-cortical connection.},

These models can feature novel dynamical equations, their interactions with the environment, and experimental protocols. To preserve high performance when defining new models, most simulators offer two options: low-level programming or description languages. The first option requires expertise, is prone to errors, and is problematic for reproducibility. The second option cannot describe all aspects of a computational experiment, such as the potentially complex logic of a stimulation protocol. Brian addresses these issues using runtime code generation. Scientists write code with simple and concise high-level descriptions, and Brian transforms them into efficient low-level code that can run interleaved with their code. We illustrate this with several challenging examples: a plastic model of the pyloric network, a closed-loop sensorimotor model, a programmatic exploration of a neuron model, and an auditory model with real-time input.},

However, the temporal delays between population activities in successive anatomical stages were longer (typically by a half theta cycle) than expected from axon conduction velocities and passive synaptic integration of feed-forward excitatory inputs.

	abstract = {Although neural interactions are usually characterized only by their coupling strength and directionality, there is often a need to go beyond this by establishing the functional mechanisms of the interaction. We introduce the use of dynamical Bayesian inference for estimation of the coupling functions of neural oscillations in the presence of noise. By grouping the partial functional contributions, the coupling is decomposed into its functional components and its most important characteristics—strength and form—are quantiﬁed. The method is applied to characterize the δ-to-α phase-to-phase neural coupling functions from electroencephalographic ({EEG}) data of the human resting state, and the differences that arise when the eyes are either open ({EO}) or closed ({EC}) are evaluated. The δ-to-α phase-to-phase coupling functions were reconstructed, quantiﬁed, compared, and followed as they evolved in time. Using phase-shufﬂed surrogates to test for signiﬁcance, we show how the strength of the direct coupling, and the similarity and variability of the coupling functions, characterize the {EO} and {EC} states for different regions of the brain. We conﬁrm an earlier observation that the direct coupling is stronger during {EC}, and we show for the ﬁrst time that the coupling function is signiﬁcantly less variable. Given the current understanding of the effects of e.g., aging and dementia on δ-waves, as well as the effect of cognitive and emotional tasks on α-waves, one may expect that new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying certain diseases will be obtained from studies of coupling functions. In principle, any pair of coupled oscillations could be studied in the same way as those shown here.},

	abstract = {Background and objective: Causality deﬁned by Granger in 1969 is a widely used concept, particularly in neuroscience and economics. As there is an increasing interest in nonlinear causality research, a Python package with a neural-network-based causality analysis approach was created. It allows performing causality tests using neural networks based on Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}), Gated Recurrent Unit ({GRU}), or Multilayer Perceptron ({MLP}). The aim of this paper is to present the nonlinear method for causality analysis and the created Python package.
Methods: The created functions with the autoregressive ({AR}) and Generalized Radial Basis Functions ({GRBF}) neural network models were tested on simulated signals in two cases: with nonlinear dependency and with absence of causality from Y to X signal. The train-test split (70/30) was used. Errors obtained on the test set were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to determine the presence of the causality. For the chosen model, the proposed method of study the change of causality over time was presented.
Results: In the case when X was a polynomial of Y, nonlinear methods were able to detect the causality, while the {AR} model did not manage to indicate it. The best results (in terms of the prediction accuracy) were obtained for the {MLP} for the lag of 150 ({MSE} equal to 0.011, compared to 0.041 and 0.036 for {AR} and {GRBF}, respectively). When there was no causality between the signals, none of the proposed and {AR} models did indicate false causality, while it was detected by {GRBF} models in one case. Only the proposed models gave the expected results in each of the tested scenarios.
Conclusions: The proposed method appeared to be superior to the compared methods. They were able to detect non-linear causality, make accurate forecasting and not indicate false causality. The created package enables easy usage of neural networks to study the causal relationship between signals. The neuralnetworks-based approach is a suitable method that allows the detection of a nonlinear causal relationship, which cannot be detected by the classical Granger method. Unlike other similar tools, the package allows for the study of changes in causality over time.},

	abstract = {Background: Wiener-Granger causality (“G-causality”) is a statistical notion of causality applicable to time series data, whereby cause precedes, and helps predict, eﬀect. It is deﬁned in both time and frequency domains, and allows for the conditioning out of common causal inﬂuences. Originally developed in the context of econometric theory, it has since achieved broad application in the neurosciences and beyond. Prediction in the G-causality formalism is based on {VAR} (Vector {AutoRegressive}) modelling. New Method: The {MVGC} Matlab c Toolbox approach to G-causal inference is based on multiple equivalent representations of a {VAR} model by (i) regression parameters, (ii) the autocovariance sequence and (iii) the cross-power spectral density of the underlying process. It features a variety of algorithms for moving between these representations, enabling selection of the most suitable algorithms with regard to computational eﬃciency and numerical accuracy.
Results: In this paper we explain the theoretical basis, computational strategy and application to empirical G-causal inference of the {MVGC} Toolbox. We also show via numerical simulations the advantages of our Toolbox over previous methods in terms of computational accuracy and statistical inference.
Comparison with Existing Method(s): The standard method of computing G-causality involves estimation of parameters for both a full and a nested (reduced) {VAR} model. The {MVGC} approach, by contrast, avoids explicit estimation of the reduced model, thus eliminating a source of estimation error and improving statistical power, and in addition facilitates fast and accurate estimation of the computationally awkward case of conditional G-causality in the frequency domain.
Conclusions: The {MVGC} Toolbox implements a ﬂexible, powerful and eﬃcient approach to G-causal inference.},

Recently, we have shown that multiple theta rhythms coexist in the hippocampus, reﬂecting the activity in their afferent regions in {CA}3 (Schaffer collaterals) and the entorhinal cortex layers {II} ({EC}-{II}, perforant pathway) and {III} ({EC}-{III}, temporoammonic pathway). Frequency and phase coupling between theta rhythms were modulated by the behavioral state, with synchronized theta rhythmicity preferentially occurring in tasks involving memory updating. However, information transmission between theta generators was not investigated. Here, we used source separation techniques to disentangle the current generators recorded in the hippocampus of rats exploring a known environment with or without a novel stimulus. We applied analytical tools based on Granger causality and transfer entropy to investigate linear and non-linear directed interactions, respectively, between the theta activities. Exploration in the novelty condition was associated with increased theta power in the generators with {EC} origin. We found a signiﬁcant directed interaction from the Schaffer input over the {EC}-{III} input in {CA}1, and a bidirectional interaction between the inputs in the hippocampus originating in the {EC}, likely reﬂecting the connection between layers {II} and {III}. During novelty exploration, the inﬂuence of the {EC}-{II} over the {EC}-{III} generator increased, while the Schaffer inﬂuence decreased. These results associate the increase in hippocampal theta activity and synchrony during novelty exploration with an increase in the directed functional connectivity from {EC}-{II} to {EC}-{III}.},

Usually, these algorithms have not been validated on a neurophysiological data set for which the actual circuitry is known. Recent work has shown that traditional network inference algorithms based on linear models typically fail to identify the correct coupling of a small central pattern generating circuit in the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab Cancer borealis. In this work, we show that point process models of observed spike trains can guide inference of relative connectivity estimates that match the known physiological connectivity of the central pattern generator up to a choice of threshold. We elucidate the necessary steps to derive faithful connectivity estimates from a model that incorporates the spike train nature of the data. We then apply the model to measure changes in the effective connectivity pattern in response to two pharmacological interventions, which affect both intrinsic neural dynamics and synaptic transmission. Our results provide the first successful application of a network inference algorithm to a circuit for which the actual physiological synapses between neurons are known. The point process methodology presented here generalizes well to larger networks and can describe the statistics of neural populations. In general we show that advanced statistical models allow for the characterization of effective network structure, deciphering underlying network dynamics and estimating information-processing capabilities.},

	abstract = {Assessing directional influences between neurons is instrumental to understand how brain circuits process information. To this end, Granger causality, a technique originally developed for time-continuous signals, has been extended to discrete spike trains. A fundamental assumption of this technique is that the temporal evolution of neuronal responses must be due only to endogenous interactions between recorded units, including self-interactions. This assumption is however rarely met in neurophysiological studies, where the response of each neuron is modulated by other exogenous causes such as, for example, other unobserved units or slow adaptation processes. Here, we propose a novel point-process Granger causality technique that is robust with respect to the two most common exogenous modulations observed in real neuronal responses: within-trial temporal variations in spiking rate and between-trial variability in their magnitudes. This novel method works by explicitly including both types of modulations into the generalized linear model of the neuronal conditional intensity function ({CIF}).

In synthetic data sets, generated by means of random processes or networks of integrate-and-fire units, the proposed method recovered with high accuracy, sensitivity and robustness the underlying ground-truth connectivity pattern. Application of presently available point-process Granger causality techniques produced instead a significant number of false positive connections. In real spiking responses recorded from neurons in the monkey pre-motor cortex (area F5), our method revealed many causal relationships between neurons as well as the temporal structure of their interactions. Given its robustness our method can be effectively applied to real neuronal data. Furthermore, its explicit estimate of the effects of unobserved causes on the recorded neuronal firing patterns can help decomposing their temporal variations into endogenous and exogenous components.},

However, the basis for Granger causality estimation is autoregressive data modeling, which is not directly applicable to spike trains. Various filtering options distort the properties of spike trains as point processes. Here we propose a new nonparametric approach to estimate Granger causality directly from the Fourier transforms of spike train data.

            The specific connectivity of a neuronal network is reflected in the dynamics of the signals recorded on its nodes. The analysis of how the activity in one node predicts the behaviour of another gives the directionality in their relationship. However, each node is composed of many different elements which define the properties of the links. For instance, excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subtypes determine the functionality of the connection. Classic indexes such as the Granger causality ({GC}) quantifies these interactions, but they do not infer into the mechanism behind them. Here, we introduce an extension of the well-known {GC} that analyses the correlation associated to the specific influence that a transmitter node has over the receiver. This way, the G-causal link has a positive or negative effect if the predicted activity follows directly or inversely, respectively, the dynamics of the sender. The method is validated in a neuronal population model, testing the paradigm that excitatory and inhibitory neurons have a differential effect in the connectivity. Our approach correctly infers the positive or negative coupling produced by different types of neurons. Our results suggest that the proposed approach provides additional information on the characterization of G-causal connections, which is potentially relevant when it comes to understanding interactions in the brain circuits.},

Based on non-linear auto-regressive models, the proposed method provides a generative and parametric model of the time-varying spectral content of the signals. As this method models the entire spectrum simultaneously, it avoids the pitfalls related to incorrect filtering or the use of the Hilbert transform on wide-band signals. As the model is probabilistic, it also provides a score of the model “goodness of fit” via the likelihood, enabling easy and legitimate model selection and parameter comparison; this data-driven feature is unique to our model-based approach. Using three datasets obtained with invasive neurophysiological recordings in humans and rodents, we demonstrate that these models are able to replicate previous results obtained with other metrics, but also reveal new insights such as the influence of the amplitude of the slow oscillation. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our parametric method can reveal neural couplings with shorter signals than non-parametric methods. We also show how the likelihood can be used to find optimal filtering parameters, suggesting new properties on the spectrum of the driving signal, but also to estimate the optimal delay between the coupled signals, enabling a directionality estimation in the coupling.},

Moreover, the modulation patterns uncovered distinctions among both high- and low-frequency subbands.

Using human intracranial {EEG} ({iEEG}) data, we provide evidence for multiple oscillatory patterns, as characterized on the basis of their spatial maps (topographies) and their frequency spectra.

We had the opportunity to record signals intracranially from occipital visual areas in an epileptic patient and quantified inter-areal signal coupling while the patient performed a visual delayed-match-to-sample task. We computed coherence, phase consistency and amplitude envelope correlation and we also determined inter-frequency coupling through correlation between low-frequency signal components and amplitude envelopes of high-frequency components. There was a pronounced task-related increase of correlation between gamma-band (28-70 Hz) signal envelopes from a superior (occipital) and low-frequency (0-3.5 Hz) signals from an inferior (occipital) visual area, lasting for approximately 1 s and possibly reflecting a short-term memory encoding process. The correlational delay between envelopes and low-frequency components was 40 ms. In contrast, coherence, phase consistency and envelope correlation showed event-, but no task-related changes of intra-areal and no changes of inter-areal coupling. Our data suggest a specific effect of gamma-activity in the superior onto low-frequency activity in the inferior area. We argue that temporal dispersion of conduction delays might prevent coherent transmission of high-frequency signals and thus account for the absence of gamma-coherence. As such dispersion is a general property of long-range projections, envelope-to-signal correlation possibly reflects a general neuronal mechanism.

Many methods have been proposed to assess the interactions between different frequency rhythms, in particular measures that characterize the relationship between the phase of a low frequency rhythm and the amplitude envelope of a high frequency rhythm. However, an optimal analysis method to assess this cross-frequency coupling ({CFC}) does not yet exist.

Results: We illustrate the utility of this procedure in three synthetic examples.

Comparison with existing methods: Compared to existing methods, the proposed {GLM}-{CFC} procedure is easily interpretable, possesses confidence intervals that are easy and efficient to compute, and accurately detects biphasic coupling.

	abstract = {Network science has been extensively developed to characterize the structural properties of complex systems, including brain networks inferred from neuroimaging data. As a result of the inference process, networks estimated from experimentally obtained biological data represent one instance of a larger number of realizations with similar intrinsic topology. A modelling approach is therefore needed to support statistical inference on the bottom-up local connectivity mechanisms influencing the formation of the estimated brain networks. Here, we adopted a statistical model based on exponential random graph models ({ERGMs}) to reproduce brain networks, or connectomes, estimated by spectral coherence between high-density electroencephalographic ({EEG}) signals. {ERGMs} are made up by different local graph metrics, whereas the parameters weight the respective contribution in explaining the observed network. We validated this approach in a dataset of N = 108 healthy subjects during eyes-open ({EO}) and eyesclosed ({EC}) resting-state conditions. Results showed that the tendency to form triangles and stars, reflecting clustering and node centrality, better explained the global properties of the {EEG} connectomes than other combinations of graph metrics. In particular, the synthetic networks generated by this model configuration replicated the characteristic differences found in real brain networks, with {EO} eliciting significantly higher segregation in the alpha frequency band (8-13 Hz) than {EC}. Furthermore, the fitted {ERGM} parameter values provided complementary information showing that clustering connections are significantly more represented from {EC} to {EO} in the alpha range, but also in the beta band (14-29 Hz), which is known to play a crucial role in cortical processing of visual input and externally oriented attention. Taken together, these findings support the current view of the functional segregation and integration of the brain in terms of modules and hubs, and provide a statistical approach to extract new information on the (re)organizational mechanisms in healthy and diseased brains.},

These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

	abstract = {A complete understanding of the brain requires an integrated description of the numerous scales and levels of neural organization. This means studying the interplay of genes and synapses, but also the relation between the structure and dynamics of the whole brain, which ultimately leads to different types of behavior, from perception to action, while asleep or awake. Yet multiscale brain modeling is challenging, in part because of the difficulty to simultaneously access information from multiple scales and levels. While some insight has been gained on the role of specific microcircuits on the generation of macroscale brain activity, a comprehensive characterization of how changes occurring at one scale or level can have an impact on other ones remains poorly understood. Recent efforts to address this gap include the development of new frameworks originating mostly from network science and complex systems theory. These theoretical contributions provide a powerful framework to analyze and model interconnected systems exhibiting interactions within and between different layers of information. Recent advances for the characterization of the multiscale brain organization in terms of structure-function, oscillation frequencies, and temporal evolution are presented. Efforts are reviewed on the multilayer network properties underlying the physics of higher-order organization of neuronal assemblies, as well as on the identification of multimodal network-based biomarkers of brain pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease. This Colloquium concludes with a perspective discussion of how recent results from multilayer network theory, involving generative modeling, controllability, and machine learning, could be adopted to address new questions in modern physics and neuroscience.},

Given their critical roles in shaping brain output, it is important to try to understand the functionality of their computational characteristics. To do this, we focus on specific interneuron subtypes. In particular, it has recently been shown that long-term potentiation is induced specifically on oriens-lacunosum/moleculare (O-{LM}) interneurons in hippocampus {CA}1 and that the same cells contain the highest density of dendritic sodium and potassium conductances measured to date. We have created multi-compartment models of an O-{LM} hippocampal interneuron using passive properties, channel kinetics, densities and distributions specific to this cell type, and explored its signalling characteristics. We found that spike initiation depends on both location and amount of input, as well as the intrinsic properties of the interneuron. Distal synaptic input always produces strong back-propagating spikes whereas proximal input could produce both forward- and back-propagating spikes depending on the input strength. We speculate that the highly active dendrites of these interneurons endow them with a specialized function within the hippocampal circuitry by allowing them to regulate direct and indirect signalling pathways within the hippocampus.},

	abstract = {Using an electrophysiological compartmental model of a Purkinje cell we quantified the contribution of individual active dendritic currents to processing of synaptic activity from granule cells. We used mutual information as a measure to quantify the information from the total excitatory input current ({IGlu}) encoded in each dendritic current. In this context, each active current was considered an information channel. Our analyses showed that most of the information was encoded by the calcium ({ICaP}) and calcium activated potassium ({IKc}) currents. Mutual information between {IGlu} and {ICaP} and {IKc} was sensitive to different levels of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic activity that, at the same time, resulted in the same firing rate at the soma. Since dendritic excitability could be a mechanism to regulate information processing in neurons we quantified the changes in mutual information between {IGlu} and all Purkinje cell currents as a function of the density of dendritic Ca ({gCaP}) and Kca ({gKc}) conductances. We extended our analysis to determine the window of temporal integration of {IGlu} by {ICaP} and {IKc} as a function of channel density and synaptic activity. The window of information integration has a stronger dependence on increasing values of {gKc} than on {gCaP}, but at high levels of synaptic stimulation information integration is reduced to a few milliseconds. Overall, our results show that different dendritic conductances differentially encode synaptic activity and that dendritic excitability and the level of synaptic activity regulate the flow of information in dendrites. © 2010 Coop, Cornelis and Santamaria.},

Unlike silica aerogel ({SIA}) composites, the {PIA} films were synthesized using polyimide. The resulting films maintained the original thermal and chemical properties of polyimide, which contribute to their homogeneity. The dielectric constant of the aerogel composite film was decreased to ∼2.4, a value similar to that of a {SIA} composite film. The increase in dielectric constant as a result of water adsorption exhibited by {SIA} films was counteracted by the hydrophobicity of the polyimide in the {PIA} film. The {PIA} composite film exhibited a 3\% water uptake, compared with a 29\% water uptake in the {SIA} film, indicating that the polyimide film is the preferred choice in wet conditions. The presence of a uniformly dispersed aerogel, a 1\% thermal decomposition temperature of 589 °C and a glass transition temperature of 298 °C for the {PIA} composite film were confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis ({TGA}) and differential scanning calorimetric ({DSC}) analysis, respectively.

Third, we cluster objects associated to {NFTs} according to their visual features and show that collections contain visually homogeneous objects. Finally, we investigate the predictability of {NFT} sales using simple machine learning algorithms and find that sale history and, secondarily, visual features are good predictors for price.

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003067},
	abstract = {The learning mechanism in the hippocampus has almost universally been assumed to be Hebbian in nature, where individual neurons in an engram join together with synaptic weight increases to support facilitated recall of memories later. However, it is also widely known that Hebbian learning mechanisms impose significant capacity constraints, and are generally less computationally powerful than learning mechanisms that take advantage of error signals. We show that the differential phase relationships of hippocampal subfields within the overall theta rhythm enable a powerful form of error-driven learning, which results in significantly greater capacity, as shown in computer simulations. In one phase of the theta cycle, the bidirectional connectivity between {CA}1 and entorhinal cortex can be trained in an error-driven fashion to learn to effectively encode the cortical inputs in a compact and sparse form over {CA}1. In a subsequent portion of the theta cycle, the system attempts to recall an existing memory, via the pathway from entorhinal cortex to {CA}3 and {CA}1. Finally the full theta cycle completes when a strong target encoding representation of the current input is imposed onto the {CA}1 via direct projections from entorhinal cortex. The difference between this target encoding and the attempted recall of the same representation on {CA}1 constitutes an error signal that can drive the learning of {CA}3 to {CA}1 synapses. This {CA}3 to {CA}1 pathway is critical for enabling full reinstatement of recalled hippocampal memories out in cortex. Taken together, these new learning dynamics enable a much more robust, high-capacity model of hippocampal learning than was available previously under the classical Hebbian model. © 2013 Ketz et al.},

In particular, the phase of slower oscillations modulates the power of faster oscillations. This is referred to as phase-amplitude coupling ({PAC}). Examples are alpha phase to gamma power coupling as observed in humans and theta phase to gamma power coupling as observed in the rat hippocampus. We here ask if the interaction between alpha and gamma oscillations is in the direction of the phase of slower oscillations driving the power of faster oscillations or conversely from the power of faster oscillations driving the phase of slower oscillations. To answer this question, we introduce a new measure to estimate the cross-frequency directionality ({CFD}). This measure is based on the phase-slope index ({PSI}) between the phase of slower oscillations and the power envelope of faster oscillations. Further, we propose a randomization framework for statistically evaluating the coupling measures when controlling for multiple comparisons over the investigated frequency ranges. The method was firstly validated on simulated data and next applied to resting state electrocorticography ({ECoG}) data. These results demonstrate that the method works reliably. In particular, we found that the power envelope of gamma oscillations drives the phase of slower oscillations in the alpha band. This surprising finding is not easily reconcilable with theories suggesting that feedback controlled alpha oscillations modulate feedforward processing reflected in the gamma band.},

Surrogate data testing is an essential part of many of these methods, as it enables robust statistical evaluations to ensure that the results observed are not obtained by chance, but are a true characteristic of the underlying system. The surrogate data technique is based on the comparison of a particular property of the data (a discriminating statistic) with the distribution of the same property calculated in a set of constructed signals (surrogates) which match the original data set but do not possess the property that is being tested. Fourier transform based surrogates remain the most popular, yet many more options have since been developed to test increasingly varied null hypotheses while characterizing the dynamics of complex systems, including uncorrelated and correlated noise, coupling between systems, and synchronization. Here, we provide a detailed overview of a wide range of surrogate types, discuss their practical applications and demonstrate their use in both numerically simulated and real experimental systems. We also compare the performance of various surrogate types for the detection of nonlinearity, synchronization and coherence, coupling strength between systems, and the nature of coupling.

	doi = {10.1111/ejn.13831},
	abstract = {The entorhinal-hippocampal system is an important circuit in the brain, essential for certain cognitive tasks such as memory and navigation. Different gamma oscillations occur in this circuit, with the medial entorhinal cortex ({mEC}), {CA}3 and {CA}1 all generating gamma oscillations with different properties. These three gamma oscillations converge within {CA}1, where much work has gone into trying to isolate them from each other. Here, we compared the gamma generators in the {mEC}, {CA}3 and {CA}1 using optoge-netically induced theta-gamma oscillations. Expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in principal neurons in each of the three regions allowed for the induction of gamma oscillations via sinusoidal blue light stimulation at theta frequency. Recording the oscillations in {CA}1 in vivo, we found that {CA}3 stimulation induced slower gamma oscillations than {CA}1 stimulation, matching in vivo reports of spontaneous {CA}3 and {CA}1 gamma oscillations. In brain slices ex vivo, optogenetic stimulation of {CA}3 induced slower gamma oscillations than stimulation of either {mEC} or {CA}1, whose gamma oscillations were of similar frequency. All three gamma oscillations had a current sink-source pair between the perisomatic and dendritic layers of the same region. Taking advantage of this model to analyse gamma frequency mechanisms in slice, we showed using pharmacology that all three gamma oscillations were dependent on the same types of synaptic receptor, being abolished by blockade of either type A c-aminobutyric acid receptors or a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid/kainate receptors, and insensitive to blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. These results indicate that a fast excitatory-inhibitory feedback loop underlies the generation of gamma oscillations in all three regions.},

	abstract = {Dendrite-targeting {GABAergic} interneurons powerfully control postsynaptic integration, synaptic plasticity, and learning. However, the mechanisms underlying the efficient {GABAergic} control of dendritic electrogenesis are not well understood. Using subtype-selective blockers for {GABAA} receptors, we show that dendrite-targeting somatostatin interneurons and {NO}-synthase-positive neurogliaform cells preferentially activate α5-subunit- containing {GABAA} receptors (α5-{GABAARs}), generating slow inhibitory postsynaptic currents ({IPSCs}) in hippocampal {CA}1 pyramidal cells. By contrast, only negligible contribution of these receptors could be found in perisomatic {IPSCs}, generated by fast-spiking parvalbumin interneurons. Remarkably, α5-{GABAAR}-mediated {IPSCs} were strongly outward-rectifying generating 4-fold larger conductances above –50 {mV} than at rest. Experiments and modeling show that synaptic activation of these receptors can very effectively control voltage-dependent {NMDA}-receptor activation as well as Schaffer-collateral evoked burst firing in pyramidal cells. Taken together, nonlinear-rectifying α5-{GABAARs} with slow kinetics match functional {NMDA}-receptor properties and thereby mediate powerful control of dendritic postsynaptic integration and action potential firing by dendrite-targeting interneurons.},

	abstract = {The extensive dendritic arbor of a pyramidal cell introduces considerable complexity to the integration of synaptic potentials. Propagation of dendritic potentials is largely passive, in contrast to regenerative axonal potentials that are maintained by voltage-gated sodium channels, leading to a declination in amplitude as dendritic potentials travel toward the soma in a manner that disproportionally affects distal synaptic inputs. To counteract this amplitude filtering, Schaffer collateral synapses onto {CA}1 pyramidal cells contain a varying number of {AMPA} receptors ({AMPARs}) per synapse that increases with distance from the soma, a phenomenon known as distance-dependent scaling. Here, we undertake an investigation into the molecular mechanisms of distance-dependent scaling. Using dendritic recordings from rat pyramidal neurons, we confirm the basic scaling phenomenon and find that it is expressed and can be manipulated cell autonomously. Finally, we show that it depends on the presence of both a reserve pool of {AMPARs} and the {AMPAR} subunit {GluA}2. © 2013 the authors.},

In the present study, we made whole-cell recordings from hippocampal {CA}1 pyramidal neurons and examined whether {NMDA} receptor activation was involved in synaptic responses. At low input stimulus intensity, {EPSPs} with a fast decay time were induced. As the intensity of stimulation was increased in the presence of {GABA} receptor antagonists, a depolarizing after-potential ({DAP}) was generated in addition to a fast decaying potential. A {DAP} was never observed when the input was applied to the apical dendrites. The {DAP} was suppressed by hyperpolarization or by {NMDA} receptor antagonists, but not by Na+, K+, or Ca2+ channel blockers. One possible mechanism is that the morphology of the basal dendrites favors {DAP} generation. A compartmental model simulation showed that synaptic inputs to thinner shorter dendrites generated a potential that resembled a {DAP}. Our study shows that a synaptic input to the basal dendrites of a hippocampal pyramidal neuron can generate a {NMDA} receptor-mediated potential in the presence of {GABA} receptor blockade. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and The Japan Neuroscience Society.

A progressive increase in synaptic conductance, with distance from the soma, has been reported to reduce the location dependence that should result from this arrangement. The excitatory synaptic contacts within this pathway primarily use {AMPA}- and {NMDA}-type glutamate receptors. To investigate the underlying mechanism of the increased distal excitatory postsynaptic conductance, we used outside-out patches and a fast application system to characterize the properties and distribution of synaptic glutamate receptors across the range of apical dendrites receiving Schaffer collateral input. We observed an approximately twofold increase in {AMPA}-mediated current amplitude (0.3-0.6 {nA}) in the range of {CA}1 apical dendrites that receive a uniform density of Schaffer collateral input (∼100-250 μm from soma). {NMDA}-mediated current amplitude, however, remained unchanged. We analyzed the current kinetics, agonist affinity, single-channel conductance, maximum open probability, and reversal potential of {AMPA} receptors and did not find any differences. Instead, the number of {AMPA} receptors present in our patches increased approximately twofold. These data suggest that an increase in the number of {AMPA} receptors present at distal synapses may play an important role in the distance-dependent scaling of Schaffer collateral synapses.},

The {PP} input terminates in the stratum lacunosum moleculare ∼300 μm from the cell body, whereas {SC} synapses have a more proximal location in the stratum radiatum. We compared the properties of {AMPA}- and {NMDA}-mediated transmission at these two inputs. The {AMPA}-mediated components have linear voltage dependence in both inputs. The reversal potential in the {PP} is only slightly more positive than in the {SC}, indicating that distal membrane voltage could be effectively set. The {NMDA}-mediated responses in the two pathways, however, are very different. The {PP} exhibits inward rectification, as evidenced by very low outward currents. The rectification persists in the absence of extracellular Mg2+. It cannot be attributed to clamping problems, because large outward {AMPA} currents can be observed even when conditions are modified to have the {AMPA} currents kinetically match the {NMDA} currents. Thus, it appears that the {PP} {NMDA} channels have novel properties. A second difference between the {PP} and {SC} pathways is that the {PP} has a larger {NMDA}/{AMPA} charge ratio. This difference could be observed under many conditions, including block of all voltage-dependent conductances and elimination of the negative resistance of {NMDA} channels by removing extracellular Mg2+. The difference in ratio thus cannot be attributed to regenerative currents. The higher {NMDA} component of the distal {PP} synapses could help to make these synapses more powerful under depolarizing conditions.},

In the hippocampal region {CA}1, somato-dendritic gradients of {AMPA} receptors and the hyperpolarization-activated cation conductance (Ih) counteract the effects of dendritic filtering on the amplitude, time-course, and temporal integration of distal Schaffer collateral ({SC}) synaptic inputs within stratum radiatum ({SR}). While ion channel gradients in {CA}1 distal apical trunk dendrites within {SR} have been well characterized, little is known about the patterns of ion channel expression in the distal apical tuft dendrites within stratum lacunosum moleculare ({SLM}) that receive distinct input from the entorhinal cortex via perforant path ({PP}) axons. Here, we measured local ion channels densities within these distal apical tuft dendrites to determine if the somato-dendritic gradients of Ih and {AMPA} receptors extend into distal tuft dendrites. We also determined the densities of voltage-gated sodium channels and {NMDA} receptors. We found that the densities of {AMPA} receptors, Ih, and voltage-gated sodium channels are similar in tuft dendrites in {SLM} when compared with distal apical dendrites in {SR}, while the ratio of {NMDA} receptors to {AMPA} receptors increases in tuft dendrites relative to distal apical dendrites within {SR}. These data indicate that the somato-dendritic gradients of Ih and {AMPA} receptors in apical dendrites do not extend into the distal tuft, and the relative densities of voltage-gated sodium channels and {NMDA} receptors are poised to support nonlinear integration of correlated {SC} and {PP} input. © 2012 Bittner et al.},

While it is obvious that these oscillations play an important role in cognitive processing. It remains unclear how oscillations in various frequency bands interact. In this study we have investigated phase to power locking in {MEG} activity of healthy human subjects at rest with their eyes closed. To examine cross-frequency coupling, we have computed coherence between the time course of the power in a given frequency band and the signal itself within every channel. The time-course of the power was calculated using a sliding tapered time window followed by a Fourier transform. Our findings show that high-frequency gamma power (30-70 Hz) is phase-locked to alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) in the ongoing {MEG} signals. The topography of the coupling was similar to the topography of the alpha power and was strongest over occipital areas. Interestingly, gamma activity per se was not evident in the power spectra and only became detectable when studied in relation to the alpha phase. Intracranial data from an epileptic subject confirmed these findings albeit there was slowing in both the alpha and gamma band. A tentative explanation for this phenomenon is that the visual system is inhibited during most of the alpha cycle whereas a burst of gamma activity at a specific alpha phase (e.g. at troughs) reflects a window of excitability. © 2008 Osipova et al.},

	abstract = {In the brain, coherent neuronal activities often appear simultaneously in multiple frequency bands, e.g., as combinations of alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12.5-30 Hz), gamma (30-120 Hz) oscillations, among others. These rhythms are believed to underlie information processing and cognitive functions and have been subjected to intense experimental and theoretical scrutiny. Computational modeling has provided a framework for the emergence of network-level oscillatory behavior from the interaction of spiking neurons. However, due to the strong nonlinear interactions between highly recurrent spiking populations, the interplay between cortical rhythms in multiple frequency bands has rarely been theoretically investigated. Many studies invoke multiple physiological timescales or oscillatory inputs to produce rhythms in multi-bands. Here we demonstrate the emergence of multi-band oscillations in a simple network consisting of one excitatory and one inhibitory neuronal population driven by constant input. First, we construct a data-driven, Poincar{\textbackslash}'e section theory for robust numerical observations of single-frequency oscillations bifurcating into multiple bands. Then we develop model reductions of the stochastic, nonlinear, high-dimensional neuronal network to capture the appearance of multi-band dynamics and the underlying bifurcations theoretically. Furthermore, when viewed within the reduced state space, our analysis reveals conserved geometrical features of the bifurcations on low-dimensional dynamical manifolds. These results suggest a simple geometric mechanism behind the emergence of multi-band oscillations without appealing to oscillatory inputs or multiple synaptic or neuronal timescales. Thus our work points to unexplored regimes of stochastic competition between excitation and inhibition behind the generation of dynamic, patterned neuronal activities.},

Leveraging the Hippocampome.org knowledge base, we developed a data-driven, large-scale spiking neural network ({SNN}) model of mouse {CA}3 with 8 neuron types, 90,000 neurons, 51 neuron-type specific connections, and 250,000,000 synapses. We instantiated the {SNN} in the {CARLsim}4 multi-{GPU} simulation environment using the Izhikevich and Tsodyks-Markram formalisms for neuronal and synaptic dynamics, respectively. We analyzed the resultant population activity upon transient activation. The {SNN} settled into stable oscillations with a biologically plausible grand-average firing frequency, which was robust relative to a wide range of transient activation. The diverse firing patterns of individual neuron types were consistent with existing knowledge of cell type-specific activity in vivo. Altered network structures that lacked neuron- or connection-type specificity were neither stable nor robust, highlighting the importance of neuron type circuitry. Additionally, external inputs reflecting dentate mossy fibers shifted the observed rhythms to the gamma band. We freely released the {CARLsim}4-Hippocampome framework on {GitHub} to test hippocampal hypotheses. Our {SNN} may be useful to investigate the circuit mechanisms underlying the computational functions of {CA}3.

	abstract = {Acetylcholine regulates memory encoding and retrieval by inducing the hippocampus to switch between pattern separation and pattern completion modes. However, both processes can introduce significant variations in the level of network activity and potentially cause a seizure-like spread of excitation. Thus, mechanisms that keep network excitation within certain bounds are necessary to prevent such instability. We developed a biologically realistic computational model of the hippocampus to investigate potential intrinsic mechanisms that might stabilize the network dynamics during encoding and retrieval. The model was developed by matching experimental data, including neuronal behavior, synaptic current dynamics, network spatial connectivity patterns, and short-term synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, it was constrained to perform pattern completion and separation under the effects of acetylcholine. The model was then used to investigate the role of short-term synaptic depression at the recurrent synapses in {CA}3, and inhibition by basket cell ({BC}) interneurons and oriens lacunosum-moleculare ({OLM}) interneurons in stabilizing these processes. Results showed that when {CA}3 was considered in isolation, inhibition solely by {BCs} was not sufficient to control instability. However, both inhibition by {OLM} cells and short-term depression at the recurrent {CA}3 connections stabilized the network activity. In the larger network including the dentate gyrus, the model suggested that {OLM} inhibition could control the network during high cholinergic levels while depressing synapses at the recurrent {CA}3 connections were important during low cholinergic states. Our results demonstrate that short-term plasticity is a critical property of the network that enhances its robustness. Furthermore, simulations suggested that the low and high cholinergic states can each produce runaway excitation through unique mechanisms and different pathologies. Future studies aimed at elucidating the circuit mechanisms of epilepsy could benefit from considering the two modulatory states separately.},

It has been argued that the {CA}3 region works as an auto-associative memory and that its recurrent fibers are the actual storing place of the memories. Furthermore, to work properly {CA}3 requires memory patterns that are mutually uncorrelated. It has been suggested that the dentate gyrus orthogonalizes the patterns before storage, a process known as pattern separation. In this study we review the model when random input patterns are presented for storage and investigate whether it is capable of storing patterns of more realistic entorhinal grid cell input. Surprisingly, we find that an auto-associative {CA}3 net is redundant for random inputs up to moderate noise levels and is only beneficial at high noise levels. When grid cell input is presented, auto-association is even harmful for memory performance at all levels. Furthermore, we find that Hebbian learning in the dentate gyrus does not support its function as a pattern separator.

However, this list may be incomplete; additionally, it is unclear whether discrete classes are sufficient to describe the diversity of cortical inhibitory neurons or whether continuous modes of variability are also required. We studied the transcriptomes of 3,663 {CA}1 inhibitory cells, revealing 10 major {GABAergic} groups that divided into 49 fine-scale clusters. All previously described and several novel cell classes were identified, with three previously described classes unexpectedly found to be identical. A division into discrete classes, however, was not sufficient to describe the diversity of these cells, as continuous variation also occurred between and within classes. Latent factor analysis revealed that a single continuous variable could predict the expression levels of several genes, which correlated similarly with it across multiple cell types. Analysis of the genes correlating with this variable suggested it reflects a range from metabolically highly active faster-spiking cells that proximally target pyramidal cells to slower-spiking cells targeting distal dendrites or interneurons. These results elucidate the complexity of inhibitory neurons in one of the simplest cortical structures and show that characterizing these cells requires continuous modes of variation as well as discrete cell classes.},

	abstract = {Scientists have observed local field potential theta rhythms (3–12 Hz) in the hippocampus for decades, but understanding the mechanisms underlying their generation is complicated by their diversity in pharmacological and frequency profiles. In addition, interactions with other brain structures and oscillatory drives to the hippocampus during distinct brain states has made it difficult to identify hippocampus-specific properties directly involved in theta generation. To overcome this, we develop cellular-based network models using a whole hippocampus in vitro preparation that spontaneously generates theta rhythms. Building on theoretical and computational analyses, we find that spike frequency adaptation and postinhibitory rebound constitute a basis for theta generation in large, minimally connected {CA}1 pyramidal ({PYR}) cell network models with fast-firing parvalbumin-positive ({PV}+) inhibitory cells. Sparse firing of {PYR} cells and large excitatory currents onto {PV}+ cells are present as in experiments. The particular theta frequency is more controlled by {PYR}-to-{PV}+ cell interactions rather than {PV}+-to-{PYR} cell interactions. We identify two scenarios by which theta rhythms can emerge, and they can be differentiated by the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory currents to {PV}+ cells, but not to {PYR} cells. Only one of the scenarios is consistent with data from the whole hippocampus preparation, which leads to the prediction that the connection probability from {PV}+ to {PYR} cells needs to be larger than from {PYR} to {PV}+ cells. Our models can serve as a platform on which to build and develop an understanding of in vivo theta generation.},

	abstract = {Mossy cell loss and mossy fiber sprouting are two characteristic consequences of repeated seizures and head trauma. However, their precise contributions to the hyperexcitable state are not well understood. Because it is difficult, and frequently impossible, to independently examine using experimental techniques whether it is the loss of mossy cells or the sprouting of mossy fibers that leads to dentate hyperexcitability, we built a biophysically realistic and anatomically representative computational model of the dentate gyms to examine this question. The 527-cell model, containing granule, mossy, basket, and hilar cells with axonal projections to the perforant-path termination zone, showed that even weak mossy fiber sprouting (10-15\% of the strong sprouting observed in the pilocarpine model of epilepsy) resulted in the spread of seizure-like activity to the adjacent model hippocampal laminae after focal stimulation of the perforant path. The simulations also indicated that the spatially restricted, lamellar distribution of the sprouted mossy fiber contacts reported in in vivo studies was an important factor in sustaining seizure-like activity in the network. In contrast to the robust hyperexcitability-inducing effects of mossy fiber sprouting, removal of mossy cells resulted in decreased granule cell responses to perforant-path activation in agreement with recent experimental data. These results indicate the crucial role of mossy fiber sprouting even in situations where there is only relatively weak mossy fiber sprouting as is the case after moderate concussive experimental head injury.

For decades these Fourier-based approaches have successfully uncovered links between oscillations and cognition or disease. However, because of the fundamental sinusoidal basis, these methods might not fully capture neural oscillatory dynamics, because neural data are both nonsinusoidal and non-stationary. Here, we present a new analysis framework, complementary to Fourier analysis, that quantifies cycle-by-cycle time-domain features. For each cycle, the amplitude, period, and waveform symmetry are measured, the latter of which is missed using conventional approaches. Additionally, oscillatory bursts are algorithmically identified, allowing us to investigate the variability of oscillatory features within and between bursts. This approach is validated on simulated noisy signals with oscillatory bursts and outperforms conventional metrics. Further, these methods are applied to real data—including hippocampal theta, motor cortical beta, and visual cortical alpha—and can differentiate behavioral conditions.},

We show that this biologically inspired mechanism leads to a substantial improvement of the performance of artificial and spiking networks with feedforward, convolutional, and recurrent architectures, it mitigates catastrophic forgetting, and it is optimally suited for dedicated hardware implementations.

We found desynchronized interneuron firing between the {CA}1 and dentate gyrus in epileptic mice. Since hippocampal interneurons control information processing, we tested whether {CA}1 spatial coding was altered in this desynchronized circuit, using a novel wire-free miniscope. We found that {CA}1 place cells in epileptic mice were unstable and completely remapped across a week. This spatial instability emerged around 6 weeks after status epilepticus, well after the onset of chronic seizures and interneuron death. Finally, {CA}1 network modeling showed that desynchronized inputs can impair the precision and stability of {CA}1 place cells.

During theta activity, pyramidal cells and different classes of interneurons were shown to discharge at different phases of the extracellular theta. A recent in vitro study has shown that theta-frequency oscillation can be elicited in a hippocampal {CA}1 slice by the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors with similar pharmacological and physiological profile that was found in vivo. We constructed a conductance based three-population network model of the hippocampal {CA}1 region to study the specific roles of neuron types in the generation of the in vitro theta oscillation and the emergent network properties. Interactions between pairs of neuron populations were studied systematically to assess synchronization and delay properties. We showed that the circuitry consisting of pyramidal cells and two types of hippocampal interneurons [basket and oriens lacunosum-moleculare (O-{LM}) neurons] was able to generate coherent theta-frequency population oscillation. Furthermore, we found that hyperpolarization-activated nonspecific cation current in pyramidal cells, but not in O-{LM} neurons, plays an important role in the timing of spike generation, and thus synchronization of pyramidal cells. The model was shown to exhibit the same phase differences between neuron population activities found in vivo, supporting the idea that these patterns of activity are determined internal to the hippocampus.

	abstract = {There is great interest in the role of coherent oscillations in the brain. In some cases, high-frequency oscillations ({HFOs}) are integral to normal brain function, whereas at other times they are implicated as markers of epileptic tissue. Mechanisms underlying {HFO} generation, especially in abnormal tissue, are not well understood. Using a physiological computer model of hippocampus, we investigate random synaptic activity (noise) as a potential initiator of {HFOs}. We explore parameters necessary to produce these oscillations and quantify the response using the tools of stochastic resonance ({SR}) and coherence resonance ({CR}). As predicted by {SR}, when noise was added to the network the model was able to detect a subthreshold periodic signal. Addition of basket cell interneurons produced two novel {SR} effects: 1) improved signal detection at low noise levels and 2) formation of coherent oscillations at high noise that were entrained to harmonics of the signal frequency. The periodic signal was then removed to study oscillations generated only by noise. The combined effects of network coupling and synaptic noise produced coherent, periodic oscillations within the network, an example of {CR}. Our results show that, under normal coupling conditions, synaptic noise was able to produce gamma (30-100 Hz) frequency oscillations. Synaptic noise generated {HFOs} in the ripple range (100-200 Hz) when the network had parameters similar to pathological findings in epilepsy: increased gap junctions or recurrent synaptic connections, loss of inhibitory interneurons such as basket cells, and increased synaptic noise. The model parameters that generated these effects are comparable with published experimental data. We propose that increased synaptic noise and physiological coupling mechanisms are sufficient to generate gamma oscillations and that pathologic changes in noise and coupling similar to those in epilepsy can produce abnormal ripples.

In particular, the oriens lacunosum-moleculare (O-{LM}) interneurons were shown to synapse on distal apical dendrites of pyramidal cells and to spike preferentially at theta frequency, even in the presence of gamma-field oscillations. O-{LM} cells have also recently been shown to present higher axonal ramification in the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus. By using a hippocampal network model composed of pyramidal cells and two types of interneurons (O-{LM} and basket cells), we show here that the O-{LM} interneurons lead to gamma coherence between anatomically distinct cell modules.

We have used biophysical modeling to address two major questions raised by the septal pacemaker hypothesis: what is the ion channel mechanism for the single-cell pacemaker behavior and how do these cells become synchronized? Our model predicts that theta oscillations of septal {GABAergic} cells depend critically on a low-threshold, slowly inactivating potassium current. Network simulations show that theta oscillations are not coherent in an isolated population of pacemaker cells. Robust synchronization emerges with the addition of a second {GABAergic} cell population. Such a reciprocally inhibitory circuit can be realized by the hippocampo-septal feedback loop.},

Using computer simulations, we investigated the hypothesis that such rhythmic activity can emerge in a random network of interconnected {GABAergic} fast-spiking interneurons. Specific conditions for the population synchronization, on properties of single cells and the circuit, were identified. These include the following: (1) that the amplitude of spike afterhyperpolarization be above the {GABA}(A) synaptic reversal potential; (2) that the ratio between the synaptic decay time constant and the oscillation period be sufficiently large; (3) that the effects of heterogeneities be modest because of a steep frequency-current relationship of fast-spiking neurons. Furthermore, using a population coherence measure, based on coincident firings of neural pairs, it is demonstrated that large-scale network synchronization requires a critical (minimal) average number of synaptic contacts per cell, which is not sensitive to the network size. By changing the {GABA}(A) synaptic maximal conductance, synaptic decay time constant, or the mean external excitatory drive to the network, the neuronal firing frequencies were gradually and monotonically varied. By contrast, the network synchronization was found to be high only within a frequency band coinciding with the gamma (20-80 Hz) range. We conclude that the {GABA}(A) synaptic transmission provides a suitable mechanism for synchronized gamma oscillations in a sparsely connected network of fast-spiking interneurons. In turn, the interneuronal network can presumably maintain subthreshold oscillations in principal cell populations and serve to synchronize discharges of spatially distributed neurons.},

	abstract = {There is increasing interest in how the phase of local oscillatory activity within a brain area determines the long-range functional connectivity of that area. For example, increasing convergent evidence from a range of methodologies suggests that beta (20 Hz) oscillations may play a vital role in the function of the motor system [1–5]. The “communication through coherence” hypothesis posits that the precise phase of coherent oscillations in network nodes is a determinant of successful communication between them [6, 7]. Here we set out to determine whether oscillatory activity in the beta band serves to support this theory within the cortical motor network in vivo. We combined non-invasive transcranial alternating-current stimulation ({tACS}) [8–12] with resting-state functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) [13] to follow both changes in local activity and long-range connectivity, determined by inter-areal blood-oxygen-level-dependent ({BOLD}) signal correlation, as a proxy for communication in the human cortex. Twelve healthy subjects participated in three {fMRI} scans with 20 Hz, 5 Hz, or sham {tACS} applied separately on each scan. Transcranial magnetic stimulation ({TMS}) at beta frequency has previously been shown to increase local activity in the beta band [14] and to modulate long-range connectivity within the default mode network [15]. We demonstrated that beta-frequency {tACS} significantly changed the connectivity pattern of the stimulated primary motor cortex (M1), without changing overall local activity or network connectivity. This finding is supported by a simple phase-precession model, which demonstrates the plausibility of the results and provides emergent predictions that are consistent with our empirical findings. These findings therefore inform our understanding of how local oscillatory activity may underpin network connectivity. Weinrich et al. show that entraining the phase of oscillations in one brain region modulates the connectivity pattern of that region without altering the strength of its connectivity with any specific region. These data provide evidence for how disordered functional communication arises in conditions characterized by perturbation of oscillations.},

In two experiments, participants received 20-min of either α-{tACS} (1 {mA}) or sham stimulation. Magnetoencephalogram ({MEG}) was recorded for 10-min before and after stimulation. {tACS} caused a larger power increase in the α-band compared to sham.

Our results directly link electric field variability to variability of {tACS} outcomes, underline the importance of individualizing stimulation protocols, and provide a novel approach to analyze {tACS} effects in terms of dose-response relationships.},

	abstract = {Brain connectivity plays a major role in the encoding, transfer, and integration of sensory information. Interregional synchronization of neural oscillations in the γ-frequency band has been suggested as a key mechanism underlying perceptual integration. In a recent study, we found evidence for this hypothesis showing that the modulation of interhemispheric oscillatory synchrony by means of bihemispheric high-density transcranial alternating current stimulation ({HD}-{TACS}) affects binaural integration of dichotic acoustic features. Here, we aimed to establish a direct link between oscillatory synchrony, effective brain connectivity, and binaural integration. We experimentally manipulated oscillatory synchrony (using bihemispheric γ-{TACS} with different interhemispheric phase lags) and assessed the effect on effective brain connectivity and binaural integration (as measured with functional {MRI} and a dichotic listening task, respectively). We found that {TACS} reduced intrahemispheric connectivity within the auditory cortices and antiphase (interhemispheric phase lag 180°) {TACS} modulated connectivity between the two auditory cortices. Importantly, the changes in intra- and interhemispheric connectivity induced by {TACS} were correlated with changes in perceptual integration. Our results indicate that γ-band synchronization between the two auditory cortices plays a functional role in binaural integration, supporting the proposed role of interregional oscillatory synchrony in perceptual integration.},

	abstract = {Using The Virtual Brain ({TVB}, thevirtualbrian.org) simulation platform, we explored for 50 individual adult human brains (ages 18-80), how personalized connectome based brain network modelling captures various empirical observations as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) and electroencephalography ({EEG}). We compare simulated activity based on individual structural connectomes ({SC}) inferred from diffusion weighted imaging with {fMRI} and {EEG} in the resting state. We systematically explore the role of the following model parameters: conduction velocity, global coupling and graph theoretical features of individual {SC}. First, a subspace of the parameter space is identified for each subject that results in realistic brain activity, i.e. reproducing the following prominent features of empirical {EEG}-{fMRI} activity: topology of resting-state {fMRI} functional connectivity ({FC}), functional connectivity dynamics ({FCD}), electrophysiological oscillations in the delta (3-4 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) frequency range and their bimodality, i.e. low and high energy modes. Interestingly, {FCD} fit, bimodality and static {FC} fit are highly correlated. They all show their optimum in the same range of global coupling. In other words, only when our local model is in a bistable regime we are able to generate switching of modes in our global network. Second, our simulations reveal the explicit network mechanisms that lead to electrophysiological oscillations, their bimodal behaviour and inter-regional differences. Third, we discuss biological interpretability of the Stefanescu-Jirsa-Hindmarsh-Rose-3D model when embedded inside the large-scale brain network and mechanisms underlying the emergence of bimodality of the neural signal. With the present study, we set the cornerstone for a systematic catalogue of spatiotemporal brain activity regimes generated with the connectome-based brain simulation platform The Virtual Brain. Author Summary In order to understand brain dynamics we use numerical simulations of brain network models. Combining the structural backbone of the brain, that is the white matter fibres connecting distinct regions in the grey matter, with dynamical systems describing the activity of neural populations we are able to simulate brain function on a large scale. In order to make accurate prediction with this network, it is crucial to determine optimal model parameters. We here use an explorative approach to adjust model parameters to individual brain activity, showing that subjects have their own optimal point in the parameter space, depending on their brain structure and function. At the same time, we investigate the relation between bistable phenomena on the scale of neural populations and the changed in functional connectivity on the brain network scale. Our results are important for future modelling approaches trying to make accurate predictions of brain function.},

	abstract = {Clinical effects of transcranial electrical stimulation with weak currents are remarkable considering the low amplitude of the electric fields acting on the brain. Elucidating the processes by which small currents affect ongoing brain activity is of paramount importance for the rational design of noninvasive electrotherapeutic strategies and to determine the relevance of endogenous fields. We propose that in active neuronal networks, weak electrical fields induce small but coherent changes in the firing rate and timing of neuronal populations that can be magnified by dynamic network activity. Specifically, we show that carbachol-induced gamma oscillations (25-35 Hz) in rat hippocampal slices have an inherent rate-limiting dynamic and timing precision that govern susceptibility to low-frequency weak electric fields ({\textless}50 Hz;{\textless}10 V/m). This leads to a range of nonlinear responses, including the following: (1) asymmetric power modulation by {DC} fields resulting from balanced excitation and inhibition; (2) symmetric power modulation by lower frequency {AC} fields with a net-zero change in firing rate; and (3) half-harmonic oscillations for higher frequency {AC} fields resulting from increased spike timing precision. These underlying mechanisms were elucidated by slice experiments and a parsimonious computational network model of single-compartment spiking neurons responding to electric field stimulation with small incremental polarization. Intracellular recordings confirmed model predictions on neuronal timing and rate changes, as well as spike phase-entrainment resonance at 0.2 V/m. Finally, our data and mechanistic framework provide a functional role for endogenous electric fields, specifically illustrating that modulation of gamma oscillations during theta-modulated gamma activity can result from field effects alone.

Particularly, {tACS} offers the unique opportunity to causally link brain oscillations of a specific frequency range to cognitive processes, because it uses sinusoidal currents that are bound to one frequency only. Using {tACS} allows to modulate brain oscillations and in turn to influence cognitive processes, thereby demonstrating the causal link between the two.

	abstract = {Introduction. While the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases and dementia increases, our knowledge of the underlying pathomechanisms and related diagnostic biomarkers, outcome predictors, or therapeutic targets remains limited. In this article, we show how computational multi-scale brain network modeling using The Virtual Brain ({TVB}) simulation platform supports revealing potential disease mechanisms and can lead to improved diagnostics. Methods. {TVB} allows standardized large-scale structural connectivity ({SC})-based modeling and simulation of whole-brain dynamics. We combine {TVB} with a cause-and-effect model for amyloid-beta, and machine-learning classification with support vector machines and random forests. The amyloid-beta burden as quantified from individual {AV}-45 {PET} scans informs parameters of local excitation/inhibition balance. We use magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}), positron emission tomography ({PET}, specifically Amyloid-beta (Abeta) binding tracer {AV}-45-{PET}, and Tau-protein (Tau) binding {AV}-1451-{PET}) from 33 participants of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study 3 ({ADNI}3). The frequency compositions of simulated local field potentials ({LFP}) are under investigation for their potential to classify individuals between Alzheimer's disease ({AD}), Mild Cognitive Impairment ({MCI}), and healthy controls ({HC}) using support vector machines and random forest classifiers. Results. The combination of empirical features (subcortical volumetry, {AV}-45-and {AV}-1451-{PET} standard uptake value ratio, {SUVR} per region) and simulated features (mean {LFP} frequency per brain region) significantly outperformed the classification accuracy of empirical data alone by about 10\% in the accuracy index of weighted F1-score (empirical 64.34\% vs. combined 74.28\%). There was no significant difference between empirical and simulated features alone. The features with the highest feature importance showed high biological plausibility with respect to the {AD}-typical spatial distribution of the features. This was demonstrated for all feature types, e.g., increased importance indices for the left entorhinal cortex as the most important Tau-feature, the left dorsal temporopolar cortex for Abeta, the right thalamus for {LFP} frequency, and the right putamen for volume. Discussion. In summary, here we suggest a strategy and provide proof of concept for {TVB}-inferred mechanistic biomarkers that are direct indicators of pathogenic processes in neurodegenerative disease. We show how the cause-and-effect implementation of local hyperexcitation caused by Abeta can improve the machine-learning-driven classification of {AD}. This proves {TVBs} ability to decode information in empirical data by means of {SC}-based brain simulation.},

	abstract = {Layer 6 (L6) pyramidal neurons are the only neocortical pyramidal cell type whose apical dendrite terminates in layer 4 rather than layer 1. Like layer 5 pyramidal neurons, they participate in a feedback loop with the thalamus and project to other cortical areas. Despite their unique location in the cortical microcircuit, synaptic integration in dendrites of L6 neurons has never been investigated. Given that all other neocortical pyramidal neurons perform active integration of synaptic inputs via local dendritic spike generation, we were interested to establish the apical dendritic properties of L6 pyramidal neurons. We measured active and passive properties of the apical dendrites of L6 pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory region of rat cortical slices using dual patch-clamp recordings from somata and dendrites and calcium imaging. We found that L6 pyramidal neurons share many fundamental dendritic properties with other neocortical pyramidal neurons, including the generation of local dendritic spikes under the control of dendritic inhibition, voltage-dependent support of backpropagating action potentials, timing-dependent dendritic integration, distally located I{\textless}inf{\textgreater}h{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} channels, frequency-dependent Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ spike activation, and {NMDA} spike electrogenesis in the distal apical dendrite. The results suggest that L6 pyramidal neurons integrate synaptic inputs in layer 4 similar to the way other neocortical pyramidal neurons integrate input to layer 1. Thus, L6 pyramidal neurons can perform a similar associational task operating on inputs arriving at the granular and subgranular layers. Copyright © 2010 the authors.},

	abstract = {A realistically shaped three-dimensional single-neuron model was constructed for each of four principal cell types in the neocortex in order to infer their contributions to magnetoencephalography ({MEG}) and electroencephalography ({EEG}) signals. For each cell, the soma was stimulated and the resulting intracellular current was used to compute the current dipole Q for the whole cell or separately for the apical and basal dendrites. The magnitude of Q is proportional to the magnetic field and electrical potential far from the neuron. A train of spikes and depolarization shift in an intracellular burst discharge were seen as spikes and an envelope in Q for the layer V and layer {II}/{III} pyramidal cells. The stellate cells lacked the envelope. As expected, the pyramidal cells produced a stronger Q than the stellate cells. The spikes produced by the layer V pyramidal cells (n = 4) varied between -0.78 and 2.97 {pA} m with the majority of the cells showing a current toward the pia (defined as positive). The basal dendrites, however, produced considerable spike currents. The magnitude and direction of dipole moment are in agreement with the distribution of the dendrites. The spikes in Q for the layer V pyramidal cells were produced by the transient sodium conductance and potassium conductance of delayed rectifier type; the conductances distributed along the dendrites were capable of generating spike propagation, which was seen in Q as the tail of a triphasic wave lasting several milliseconds. The envelope was similar in magnitude (-0.41 to -0.90 {pA} m) across the four layer V pyramidal cells. The spike and envelope for the layer {II}/{III} pyramidal cell were 0.47 and -0.29 {pA} m, respectively; these values agreed well with empirical and theoretical estimates for guinea pig {CA}3 pyramidal cells. Spikes were stronger for the layer {IV} spiny stellate (0.27 {pA} m) than the layer {III} aspiny stellate cell (0.06 {pA} m) along their best orientations. The spikes may thus be stronger than has been previously thought. The Q for a population of stellate cells may be weaker than a linear sum of their individual Q values due to their variable dendritic geometry. The burst discharge by pyramidal cells may be detectable with {MEG} and {EEG} when 10 000-50 000 cells are synchronously active. © 2006 The Authors.

Our simple model predicts correctly the timing of 96\% of the spikes (±2 ms) of the detailed model in response to injection of noisy synaptic conductances. The model is especially reliable in high-conductance states, typical of cortical activity in vivo, in which intrinsic conductances were found to have a reduced role in shaping spike trains. These results are promising because this simple model has enough expressive power to reproduce qualitatively several electrophysiological classes described in vitro.

	abstract = {For simulations of large spiking neuron networks, an accurate, simple and versatile single-neuron modeling framework is required. Here we explore the versatility of a simple two-equation model: the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neuron. We show that this model generates multiple firing patterns depending on the choice of parameter values, and present a phase diagram describing the transition from one firing type to another. We give an analytical criterion to distinguish between continuous adaption, initial bursting, regular bursting and two types of tonic spiking. Also, we report that the deterministic model is capable of producing irregular spiking when stimulated with constant current, indicating low-dimensional chaos. Lastly, the simple model is fitted to real experiments of cortical neurons under step current stimulation. The results provide support for the suitability of simple models such as the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neuron for large network simulations.},

	doi = {10.1002/hbm.23708},
	abstract = {Introduction: Recent evidence suggests that the conscious brain is characterized by a diverse repertoire of functional connectivity patterns while the anesthetized brain shows stereotyped activity. However, classical time-averaged methods of connectivity dismiss dynamic and temporal characteristics of functional configurations. Here we demonstrate a new approach which characterizes time-varying patterns of functional connectivity at the subsecond time scale. Methods: We introduce phase-lag entropy ({PLE}), a measure of the diversity of temporal patterns in the phase relationships between two signals. The proposed measure was applied to multichannel electroencephalogram ({EEG}), which were recorded from two distinct experimental settings: (1) propofol was administrated at a constant infusion rate for 60 min (n = 96); (2) administration of propofol by a target effect-site concentration-controlled infusion with simultaneous assessment of the level of consciousness (n = 10). Results: From the first dataset, two substantial changes of the phase relationship during anesthesia was found: (1) the dynamics of the phase relationship between frontal channels became progressively less diverse and more stereotyped during unconsciousness, quantified as a reduction in {PLE}; and (2) the reduction in {PLE} was consistent across subjects. Furthermore, {PLE} provided better performance in the classification of states of consciousness than did phase-lag index, a classical time-averaged connectivity method. From the second dataset, {PLE} showed the highest agreement with the level of consciousness, compared to existing anesthetic depth indicators. Conclusions: This study suggests that a scarcity of functional configurations is closely associated with anesthetically induced unconsciousness, and shows promise as a basis for a new consciousness monitoring system during general anesthesia.

	abstract = {Humans perform remarkably well in many cognitive tasks including pattern recognition. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying this process are not well understood. Nevertheless, artificial neural networks, inspired in brain circuits, have been designed and used to tackle spatio-temporal pattern recognition tasks. In this paper we present a multi-neuronal spike pattern detection structure able to autonomously implement online learning and recognition of parallel spike sequences (i.e., sequences of pulses belonging to different neurons/neural ensembles). The operating principle of this structure is based on two spiking/synaptic neurocomputational characteristics: spike latency, which enables neurons to fire spikes with a certain delay and heterosynaptic plasticity, which allows the own regulation of synaptic weights. From the perspective of the information representation, the structure allows mapping a spatio-temporal stimulus into a multi-dimensional, temporal, feature space. In this space, the parameter coordinate and the time at which a neuron fires represent one specific feature. In this sense, each feature can be considered to span a single temporal axis. We applied our proposed scheme to experimental data obtained from a motor-inhibitory cognitive task. The results show that out method exhibits similar performance compared with other classification methods, indicating the effectiveness of our approach. In addition, its simplicity and low computational cost suggest a large scale implementation for real time recognition applications in several areas, such as brain computer interface, personal biometrics authentication, or early detection of diseases.},

	abstract = {Abnormalities in oscillations have been suggested to play a role in schizophrenia. We studied theta-modulated gamma oscillations in a computer model of hippocampal {CA}3 in vivo with and without simulated application of ketamine, an {NMDA} receptor antagonist and psychotomimetic. Networks of 1200 multicompartment neurons [pyramidal, basket, and oriens-lacunosum moleculare ({OLM}) cells] generated theta and gamma oscillations from intrinsic network dynamics: basket cells primarily generated gamma and amplified theta, while {OLM} cells strongly contributed to theta. Extrinsic medial septal inputs paced theta and amplified both theta and gamma oscillations. Exploration of {NMDA} receptor reduction across all location combinations demonstrated that the experimentally observed ketamine effect occurred only with isolated reduction {ofNMDAreceptors} on {OLMs}. In the ketamine simulations, {lowerOLMactivity} reduced theta power and disinhibited pyramidal cells, resulting in increased basket cell activation and gamma power. Our simulations predict the following: (1) ketamine increases firing rates; (2) oscillations can be generated by intrinsic hippocampal circuits; (3) medial-septum inputs pace and augment oscillations; (4) pyramidal cells lead basket cells at the gamma peak but lag at trough; (5) basket cells amplify theta rhythms; (6) ketamine alters oscillations due to primary blockade {atOLMNMDAreceptors}; (7) ketamine alters phase relationships of cell firing; (8) ketamine reduces network responsivity to the environment; (9) ketamine effect could be reversed by providing a continuous inward current {toOLMcells}.Wesuggest that this last prediction has implications for a possible novel treatment for cognitive deficits of schizophrenia by targeting {OLM} cells. © 2011 the authors.},

Functional connectivity between 90 cortical and subcortical regions was estimated by wavelet correlation analysis, in the frequency interval 0.06-0.11 Hz, and thresholded to construct undirected graphs. These brain functional networks were small-world and economical in the sense of providing high global and local efficiency of parallel information processing for low connection cost. Efficiency was reduced disproportionately to cost in older people, and the detrimental effects of age on efficiency were localised to frontal and temporal cortical and subcortical regions. Dopamine antagonism also impaired global and local efficiency of the network, but this effect was differentially localised and did not interact with the effect of age. Brain functional networks have economical small-world properties - supporting efficient parallel information transfer at relatively low cost - which are differently impaired by normal aging and pharmacological blockade of dopamine transmission. © 2007 Achard and Bullmore.},

	abstract = {Input comparison is thought to occur in many neuronal circuits, including the hippocampus, where functionally important interactions between the Schaffer collateral and perforant pathways have been hypothesized. We investigated this idea using multisite, whole-cell recordings and Ca2+ imaging and found that properly timed, repetitive stimulation of both pathways results in the generation of large plateau potentials in distal dendrites of {CA}1 pyramidal neurons. These dendritic plateau potentials produce widespread Ca2+ influx, large after-depolarizations, burst firing output, and long-term potentiation of perforant path synapses. Plateau duration is directly related to the strength and temporal overlap of pathway activation and involves back-propagating action potentials and both {NMDA} receptors and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Thus, the occurrence of highly correlated {SC} and {PP} input to {CA}1 is signaled by a dramatic change in output mode and an increase in input efficacy, all induced by a large plateau potential in the distal dendrites of {CA}1 pyramidal neurons. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Different measures of directional influence have been employed to infer effective connectivity in the brain. When the connectivity between two regions is such that one of them (the sender) strongly influences the other (the receiver), a positive phase lag is often expected. The assumption is that the time difference implicit in the relative phase reflects the transmission time of neuronal activity. However, Brovelli et al. (2004) observed that, in monkeys engaged in processing a cognitive task, a dominant directional influence from one area of sensorimotor cortex to another may be accompanied by either a negative or a positive time delay. Here we present a model of two brain regions, coupled with a well-defined directional influence, that displays similar features to those observed in the experimental data. This model is inspired by the theoretical framework of Anticipated Synchronization developed in the field of dynamical systems. Anticipated Synchronization is a form of synchronization that occurs when a unidirectional influence is transmitted from a sender to a receiver, but the receiver leads the sender in time. This counterintuitive synchronization regime can be a stable solution of two dynamical systems coupled in a master-slave (sender-receiver) configuration when the slave receives a negative delayed self-feedback. Despite efforts to understand the dynamics of Anticipated Synchronization, experimental evidence for it in the brain has been lacking. By reproducing experimental delay times and coherence spectra, our results provide a theoretical basis for the underlying mechanisms of the observed dynamics, and suggest that the primate cortex could operate in a regime of Anticipated Synchronization as part of normal neurocognitive function. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Here we use in vivo juxtacellular recording and filling in the medial septum followed by immunocytochemical identification of the recorded cells containing parvalbumin to determine their firing pattern, phase relationship with hippocampal theta, morphology, and to thereby reveal their involvement in the generation of hippocampal theta activity. We have demonstrated that {GABAergic} medial septal neurons form two distinct populations exhibiting highly regular bursting activity that is tightly coupled to either the trough (178°) or the peak (330°) of hippocampal theta waves. Additionally, different types of bursting as well as nonbursting activity patterns were also observed. The morphological reconstruction of theta-bursting neurons revealed extensive axon arbors of these cells with numerous local collaterals establishing symmetrical synapses; thus, synchrony among the septal pacemaker units may be brought about by their recurrent collateral interactions. Long projecting axons could also be found running dorsally toward the hippocampus and ventrally in the direction of basal forebrain regions. We conclude that {GABAergic} neurons in the medial septum, which are known to selectively innervate hippocampal interneurons, are in a position to induce rhythmic disinhibition in the hippocampus and other theta-related subcortical areas at two different phases of hippocampal theta.},

	abstract = {We present a theory and computational models to couple the electric field induced by magnetic stimulation to neuronal membranes. Based on the characteristics of magnetically induced electric fields and the modified cable equation that we developed previously, quasipotentials are derived as a simple and accurate approximation for coupling of the electric fields to neurons. The conventional and modified cable equations are used to simulate magnetic stimulation of long peripheral nerves by circular and figure-8 coils. Activation thresholds are obtained over a range of lateral and vertical coil positions for two nonlinear membrane models representing unmyelinated and myelinated straight axons and also for undulating myelinated axons. For unmyelinated straight axons, the thresholds obtained with the modified cable equation are significantly lower due to transverse polarization, and the spatial distributions of thresholds as a function of coil position differ significantly from predictions by the activating function. However, the activation thresholds of unmyelinated axons obtained with either cable equation are very high and beyond the output capabilities of conventional magnetic stimulators. For myelinated axons, threshold values are similar for both cable equations and within the range of magnetic stimulators. Whereas the transverse field contributes negligibly to the activation thresholds of myelinated fibers, axonal undulation can significantly increase or decrease thresholds depending on coil position. The analysis provides a rigorous theoretical foundation and implementation methods for the use of the cable equation to model neuronal response to magnetically induced electric fields. Experimentally observed stimulation with the electric fields perpendicular to the nerve trunk cannot be explained by transverse polarization and is likely due to nerve fiber undulation and other geometrical inhomogeneities.},

	abstract = {Extracellular electrical stimulation of neural networks has been widely used empirically for decades with individual electrodes. Since recently, microtechnology provides advanced systems with high-density microelectrode arrays ({MEAs}). Taking the most of these devices for fundamental goals or developing neural prosthesis requires a good knowledge of the mechanisms underlying electrical stimulation. Here, we review modeling approaches used to determine (1) the electric potential field created by a stimulation and (2) the response of an excitable cell to an applied field. Computation of the potential field requires solving the Poisson equation. While this can be performed analytically in simple electrode-neuron configurations, numerical models are required for realistic geometries. In these models, special care must be taken to model the potential drop at the electrode/tissue interface using appropriate boundary conditions. The neural response to the field can then be calculated using compartmentalized cell models, by solving a cable equation, the source term of which (called activating function) is proportional to the second derivative of the extracellular field along the neural arborization. Analytical and numerical solutions to this equation are first presented. Then, we discuss the use of approximated solutions to intuitively predict the neuronal response: Either the " activating function" or the " mirror estimate" , depending on the pulse duration and the cell space constant. Finally, we address the design of optimal electrode configurations allowing the selective activation of neurons near each stimulation site. This can be achieved using either multipolar configurations, or the " ground surface" configuration, which can be easily integrated in high-density {MEAs}. Overall, models highlighting the mechanisms of electrical microstimulation and improving stimulating devices should help understanding the influence of extracellular fields on neural elements and developing optimized neural prostheses for rehabilitation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here we show that phase precession occurs in both spatial and non-spatial behaviours. We found that spike phase correlated with instantaneous discharge rate, and precessed unidirectionally at high rates, regardless of behaviour. The spatial phase precession phenomenon is therefore a manifestation of a more fundamental principle governing the timing of pyramidal cell discharge. We suggest that intrinsic properties of pyramidal cells have a key role in determining spike times, and that the interplay between the magnitude of dendritic excitation and rhythmic inhibition of the somatic region is responsible for the phase assignment of spikes.},

The mechanisms underlying rapid information rerouting between such microcircuits are still unknown. It has been proposed that changing patterns of coherence between local gamma rhythms support flexible information rerouting. The stochastic and transient nature of gamma oscillations in vivo, however, is hard to reconcile with such a function. Here we show that models of cortical circuits near the onset of oscillatory synchrony selectively route input signals despite the short duration of gamma bursts and the irregularity of neuronal firing. In canonical multiarea circuits, we find that gamma bursts spontaneously arise with matched timing and frequency and that they organize information flow by large-scale routing states.

We found that epochs of highly synchronized theta rhythmicity preferentially occurred during behavioral tasks requiring coordination between internal memory representations and incoming sensory information. In addition, we found that gamma oscillations were associated with specific theta generators and the strength of theta-gamma coupling predicted the synchronization between theta generators.

Each of these phenomena has thus far been observed only in systems designed to exhibit that one phenomenon, which raises the questions of whether they are mutually compatible and, if so, under what conditions they co-occur. Here, we introduce a class of remarkably simple oscillator networks that concurrently exhibit all of these phenomena. The dynamical units consist of pairs of nonidentical phase oscillators, which we refer to as Janus oscillators by analogy with Janus particles and the mythological figure from which their name is derived. In contrast to previous studies, these networks exhibit (i) explosive synchronization with identical oscillators; (ii) extreme multistability of chimera states, including traveling, intermittent, and bouncing chimeras; and (iii) asymmetry-induced synchronization in which synchronization is promoted by random oscillator heterogeneity. These networks also exhibit the previously unobserved possibility of inverted synchronization transitions, in which a transition to a more synchronous state is induced by a reduction rather than an increase in the coupling strength. These various phenomena are shown to emerge under rather parsimonious conditions and even in locally connected ring topologies, which has the potential to facilitate their use to control and manipulate synchronization in experiments.},

Specifically, animals are born with highly structured brain connectivity, which enables them to learn very rapidly. Because the wiring diagram is far too complex to be specified explicitly in the genome, it must be compressed through a “genomic bottleneck”.

Understanding whether these heterogeneous patterns of activity stem from the underlying neural dynamics operating at the edge of a phase transition is a fascinating possibility, as criticality has been argued to entail many possible important functional advantages in biological computing systems. Here, we employ a well-accepted model for neural dynamics to elucidate an alternative scenario in which diverse neuronal avalanches, obeying scaling, can coexist simultaneously, even if the network operates in a regime far from the edge of any phase transition. We show that perturbations to the system state unfold dynamically according to a “neutral drift” (i.e., guided only by stochasticity) with respect to the background of endogenous spontaneous activity, and that such a neutral dynamics—akin to neutral theories of population genetics and of biogeography—implies marginal propagation of perturbations and scale-free distributed causal avalanches. We argue that causal information, not easily accessible to experiments, is essential to elucidate the nature and statistics of neural avalanches, and that neutral dynamics is likely to play an important role in the cortex functioning. We discuss the implications of these findings to design new empirical approaches to shed further light on how the brain processes and stores information.},

The nonlinear threshold detection mechanism that neurons employ and the noisy environment in which they reside makes it likely that {SR} plays a role in neural signal detection. Although the role of {SR} in sensory neural systems has been studied extensively, its role in central neurons is unknown. In many central neurons, such as the hippocampal {CA}1 cell, very large dendritic trees are responsible for detecting neural input in a noisy environment. Attenuation due to the electrotonic length of these trees is significant, suggesting that a method other than passive summation is necessary if signals at the distal ends of the tree are to be detected. The hypothesis that {SR} plays an important role in the detection of distal synaptic inputs first was tested in a computer simulation of a {CA}1 cell and then verified with in vitro rat hippocampal slices. The results clearly showed that {SR} can enhance signal detection in {CA}1 hippocampal cells. Moreover, high levels of noise were found to equalize detection of synaptic signals received at varying positions on the dendritic tree. The amount of noise needed to evoke the effect is compared with physiological noise in slices and in vivo.},

To answer this question, we need to understand the underlying mechanisms of plasticity and their role in shaping synaptic connectivity. Theoretical neuroscience typically investigates plasticity on the level of neural networks. Neural network models often consist of point neurons, completely neglecting neuronal morphology for reasons of simplicity. However, during the past decades it became increasingly clear that inputs are locally processed in the dendrites before they reach the cell body. Dendritic properties enable local interactions between synapses and location-dependent modulations of inputs, rendering the position of synapses on dendrites highly important. These insights changed our view of neurons, such that we now think of them as small networks of nearly independent subunits instead of a simple point. Here, we propose that understanding how the brain processes information strongly requires that we consider the following properties: which plasticity mechanisms are present in the dendrites and how do they enable the self-organisation of synapses across the dendritic tree for efficient information processing? Ultimately, dendritic plasticity mechanisms can be studied in networks of neurons with dendrites, possibly uncovering unknown mechanisms that shape the connectivity in our brains.},

We study the consequences of such interactions using model neurons in which somatic burst-firing and synaptic plasticity are controlled by conjunctive processing of these separately integrated input pathways. We find that nonlinear dendritic input processing enhances the model's capacity to store and retrieve large numbers of similar memories. During memory encoding, {CA}3 stores heavily decorrelated engrams to prevent interference between similar memories, while {CA}1 pairs these engrams with information-rich memory representations that will later provide meaningful output signals during memory recall. While maintaining mathematical tractability, this model brings theoretical study of memory operations closer to the hippocampal circuit's anatomical and physiological properties, thus providing a framework for future experimental and theoretical study of hippocampal function. Dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal cells integrate incoming inputs in a highly nonlinear fashion, yet the functional roles of dendritic nonlinearities in hippocampal operations remain unknown.

Here we reveal a septo-hippocampal circuit mediated by glutamatergic ({VGluT}2+) neurons that is activated before locomotion onset and that controls the initiation and velocity of locomotion as well as theentrainment of theta oscillations. Moreover, via septo-hippocampal projections onto alveus/oriens interneurons, this circuit regulates feedforward inhibition of Schaffer collateral and perforant path input to {CA}1 pyramidal neurons in a locomotion-dependent manner.

The effect of the modular structure on the brain dynamics has been the focus of several studies in recent years but many aspects remain to be explored. For example, it is not well-known how the delays in the transmission of signals between the neurons and the brain regions interact with the modular structure to determine the brain dynamics. In this paper, we show an important impact of the delays on the collective dynamics of brain networks with modular structure; that is, the degree of the synchrony between different brain regions depends on the oscillating frequency. In particular, we show that when increasing the frequency of the nodes the network transits from a global synchrony state to an asynchronous state, through a transition region over which the local synchrony inside the modules is stronger than the global synchrony. When the delays depend on the distance between the nodes, the modular structure of different spatial scales appears in the correlation matrix over different specific frequency bands, so that, finer spatial modular structures reveal in higher frequency bands. The results are corroborated by a simple theoretical argument and elaborated by simulations on several simplified modular networks and the connectome with different spatial resolutions.},

Pyramidal cells in the {CA}1 area of the hippocampus receive 92\% of their {GABAergic} input onto dendrites. How does this {GABAergic} input participate in dendritic computations of pyramidal cells? One key to understanding their contribution to dendritic computation lies in the timing of {GABAergic} input in relation to excitatory transmission, back-propagating action potentials, Ca 2+ spikes and subthreshold membrane dynamics. The issue is further complicated by the fact that dendritic {GABAergic} inputs originate from numerous distinct sources operating with different molecular machineries and innervating different subcellular domains of pyramidal cell dendrites. The {GABAergic} input from distinct sources is likely to contribute differentially to dendritic computations. In this review, I describe four groups of {GABAergic} interneuron according to their expression of parvalbumin, cholecystokinin, axonal arborization density and long-range projections. These four interneuron groups contain at least 12 distinct cell types, which innervate mainly or exclusively the dendrites of {CA}1 pyramidal cells. Furthermore, I summarize the different spike timing of distinct interneuron types during gamma, theta and ripple oscillations in vivo, and I discuss some of the open questions on how {GABAergic} input modulates dendritic operations in {CA}1 pyramidal cells. © Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Fast spiking interneurons in the {CA}1 area of the dorsal hippocampus were recorded from and filled with biocytin in anesthetized rats. The full extent of their dendrites and axonal arborizations as well as their calcium binding protein content were examined. Based on the spatial extent of axon collaterals, local circuit cells (basket and O-{LM} neurons) and long-range cells (bistratified, trilaminar, and backprojection neurons) could be distinguished. Basket cells were immunoreactive for parvalbumin and their axon collaterals were confined to the pyramidal layer. A single basket cell contacted more than 1500 pyramidal neurons and 60 other parvalbumin-positive interneurons. Commissural stimulation directly discharged basket cells, followed by an early and late {IPSPs}, indicating interneuronal inhibition of basket cells. The dendrites of another local circuit neuron (O-{LM}) were confined to stratum oriens and it had a small but high-density axonal terminal field in stratum lacunosum-moleculare. The fastest firing cell of all interneurons was a calbindin-immunoreactive bistratified neuron with axonal targets in stratum oriens and radiatum. Two neurons with their cell bodies in the alveus innervated the {CA}3 region (backprojection cells), in addition to rich axon collaterals in the {CA}1 region. The trilaminar interneuron had axon collaterals in strata radiatum, oriens and pyramidale with its dendrites confined to stratum oriens. Commissural stimulation evoked an early {EPSP}-{IPSP}-late depolarizing potential sequence in this cell. All interneurons formed symmetric synapses with their targets at the electron microscopic level. These findings indicate that interneurons with distinct axonal targets have differential functions in shaping the physiological patterns of the {CA}1 network.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory ({LSTM}). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, {LSTM} can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. {LSTM} is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, {LSTM} leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. {LSTM} also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

Recent studies found that inter-areal gamma-band synchronization entails a non-zero phase lag. We therefore modify the {CTC} hypothesis and propose that bi-directional cortical communication is realized separately for the two directions by uni-directional {CTC} mechanisms entailing delays in both directions. We review evidence suggesting that inter-areal influences in the feedforward and feedback directions are segregated both anatomically and spectrally.},

Theta-coordinated synchronous spiking of {EC} neuronal populations predicted the timing of current sinks in target layers in the hippocampus. However, the temporal delays between population activities in successive anatomical stages were longer (typically by a half theta cycle) than expected from axon conduction velocities and passive synaptic integration of feed-forward excitatory inputs.

	abstract = {We present a numerical analysis of the dynamics of all-to-all coupled Hodgkin-Huxley ({HH}) neuronal networks with Poisson spike inputs. It is important to point out that, since the dynamical vector of the system contains discontinuous variables, we propose a so-called pseudo-Lyapunov exponent adapted from the classical definition using only continuous dynamical variables, and apply it in our numerical investigation. The numerical results of the largest Lyapunov exponent using this new definition are consistent with the dynamical regimes of the network. Three typical dynamical regimes - asynchronous, chaotic and synchronous, are found as the synaptic coupling strength increases from weak to strong. We use the pseudo-Lyapunov exponent and the power spectrum analysis of voltage traces to characterize the types of the network behavior. In the nonchaotic (asynchronous or synchronous) dynamical regimes, i.e., the weak or strong coupling limits, the pseudo-Lyapunov exponent is negative and there is a good numerical convergence of the solution in the trajectory-wise sense by using our numerical methods. Consequently, in these regimes the evolution of neuronal networks is reliable. For the chaotic dynamical regime with an intermediate strong coupling, the pseudo-Lyapunov exponent is positive, and there is no numerical convergence of the solution and only statistical quantifications of the numerical results are reliable. Finally, we present numerical evidence that the value of pseudo-Lyapunov exponent coincides with that of the standard Lyapunov exponent for systems we have been able to examine. © Springer Science+Business Media, {LLC} 2009.},

In this study, we address the question of how phase locked, and in particular zero phase lag synchronization, can be achieved for a heterogeneous system of two delayed coupled neurons. We have analytically studied the possibility of inphase synchronization and near inphase synchronization when the neurons are not identical or the connections are not exactly symmetric. We have shown that while any single source of inhomogeneity can violate isochronous synchrony, multiple sources of inhomogeneity can compensate for each other and maintain synchrony.

	abstract = {The discovery of stimulus induced synchronization in the visual cortex suggested the possibility that the relations among low-level stimulus features are encoded by the temporal relationship between neuronal discharges. In this framework, temporal coherence is considered a signature of perceptual grouping. This insight triggered a large number of experimental studies which sought to investigate the relationship between temporal coordination and cognitive functions. While some core predictions derived from the initial hypothesis were confirmed, these studies, also revealed a rich dynamical landscape beyond simple coherence whose role in signal processing is still poorly understood. In this paper, a framework is presented which establishes links between the various manifestations of cortical dynamics by assigning specific coding functions to low-dimensional dynamic features such as synchronized oscillations and phase shifts on the one hand and high-dimensional non-linear, non-stationary dynamics on the other. The data serving as basis for this synthetic approach have been obtained with chronic multisite recordings from the visual cortex of anesthetized cats and from monkeys trained to solve cognitive tasks. It is proposed that the low-dimensional dynamics characterized by synchronized oscillations and large-scale correlations are substates that represent the results of computations performed in the high-dimensional state-space provided by recurrently coupled networks.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal theta oscillations coordinate neuronal firing to support memory and spatial navigation. The medial septum ({MS}) is critical in theta generation by two possible mechanisms: either a unitary “pacemaker” timing signal is imposed on the hippocampal system, or it may assist in organizing target subcircuits within the phase space of theta oscillations. We used temperature manipulation of the {MS} to test these models. Cooling of the {MS} reduced both theta frequency and power and was associated with an enhanced incidence of errors in a spatial navigation task, but it did not affect spatial correlates of neurons. {MS} cooling decreased theta frequency oscillations of place cells and reduced distance-time compression but preserved distance-phase compression of place field sequences within the theta cycle. Thus, the septum is critical for sustaining precise theta phase coordination of cell assemblies in the hippocampal system, a mechanism needed for spatial memory. Petersen et al. demonstrate that cooling of the medial septum slows theta oscillation and increases choice errors without affecting spatial features of pyramidal neurons. Cooling affects distance-time, but not distance-theta phase, compression. The findings reveal that cell assemblies are organized by theta phase and not by external (clock) time.},

	abstract = {Hippocampal granule cells transmit information about behaviorally-relevant stimuli to {CA}3 pyramidal cells via mossy fiber synapses. These synapses express a form of long-term potentiation ({mfLTP}) that is non-Hebbian and does not require {NMDA} receptors. {mfLTP} is thought to be induced and expressed presynaptically, hence, the major determinant of whether {mfLTP} occurs is activity in the granule cells. However, it remains unclear whether {mfLTP} can be induced by activity patterns that granule cells exhibit in vivo, and-if so-what context generates these patterns. To address these issues, we examined granule cell activity from in vivo recordings from rats during performance of a delayed nonmatch-to-sample ({DNMS}) task and found that granule cells exhibit a wide range of spike patterns. In vitro slice experiments in mice demonstrated that some, but not all, of these patterns of activity could induce {mfLTP}. By further defining the activity thresholds for {mfLTP} in hippocampal slices, we found that {mfLTP} can only be induced by spike patterns that fire in high frequency bursts with a low average firing frequency. Using this information, we then screened for suprathreshold bursts of activity during the {DNMS} task. In a subset of cells, suprathreshold bursts occurred preferentially during the sampling phase of the task. If suprathreshold bursting took place later, during the delay phase, task performance was disrupted. We conclude that {mfLTP} can be induced by granule cell spike patterns during a memory task, and that the timing of {mfLTP} induction can predict task performance. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Most studies have focused on the role in memory storage of the excitatory projections from entorhinal cortex to hippocampus. However, entorhinal cortex also sends inhibitory projections, whose role in memory storage and cortico-hippocampal activity remains largely unexplored. We found that these long-range inhibitory projections enhance the specificity of contextual and object memory encoding. At the circuit level, these γ-aminobutyric acid ({GABA})-releasing projections target hippocampal inhibitory neurons and thus act as a disinhibitory gate that transiently promotes the excitation of hippocampal {CA}1 pyramidal neurons by suppressing feedforward inhibition. This enhances the ability of {CA}1 pyramidal neurons to fire synaptically evoked dendritic spikes and to generate a temporally precise form of heterosynaptic plasticity. Long-range inhibition from entorhinal cortex may thus increase the precision of hippocampal-based long-term memory associations by assessing the salience of mnemonormation to the immediate sensory input.},

Understanding the mechanisms of dynamic routing of information would have far-reaching implications in a number of disciplines ranging from biology and medicine to information technologies and engineering. In this work, we show that the presence of a node firing at a higher frequency in a network with local connections, leads to reliable transmission of signals and establishes a preferential direction of information flow. Thus, by raising the firing rate a low degree node can behave as a functional hub, spreading its activity patterns polysynaptically in the network. Therefore, in an otherwise homogeneous and undirected network, firing rate is a tunable parameter that introduces directionality and enhances the reliability of signal transmission. The intrinsic firing rate across neuronal populations may thus determine preferred routes for signal transmission that can be easily controlled by changing the firing rate in specific nodes. We show that the results are generic and the same mechanism works in the networks with more complex topology.},

	abstract = {Spike backpropagation has been proposed to enhance dendritic depolarization and synaptic plasticity. However, relatively little is known about the inhibitory control of spike backpropagation in vivo. In this study, the backpropagation of the antidromic spike into the dendrites of {CA}1 pyramidal cells was studied by extracellular recording in urethane-anesthetized rats. The population antidromic spike ({pAS}) in {CA}1 following stimulation of the alveus was recorded simultaneously with a 16-channel silicon probe and analyzed as current source density ({CSD}). The {pAS} current sink was shown to sequentially invade the soma and then the apical and basal dendrites. When the {pAS} was preceded {\textless}400 ms by a conditioning orthodromic {CA}3 stimulus, the apical and basal dendritic spike sinks were reduced and delayed. Dendritic spike suppression was large after a high-intensity {CA}3 conditioning stimulus that evoked a population spike, small after a low-intensity {CA}3 conditioning stimulus, and weak after conditioning by another {pAS}. The late (150-400 ms latency) inhibition of the backpropagating {pAS} at the apical and basal dendrites was partially relieved by a {GABAB} receptor antagonist, {CGP}35348 or {CGP}56999A, given intracerebroventricularly (icv). {CGP}35348 icv also decreased the latency of the antidromic spike sinks at all depths. A compartment cable model of a {CA}1 pyramidal cell with excitable dendrites, combined with a model of extracellular potential generation, confirms that {GABAB} receptor activation delays a back-propagating spike and blocks distal dendritic spikes. {GABAB} receptor-mediated conductance increase and hyperpolarization, amplified by removing dendritic {IA} inactivation, contribute to conditioned dendritic spike suppression. In addition, the model shows that slow Na+ channel inactivation also participates in conditioned spike suppression, which may partly explain the small dendritic spike suppression after conditioning with a weak orthodromic stimulus or another antidromic spike. Thus, both theory and experiment confirm an important role of the {GABAB} receptors in controlling dendritic spike backpropagation. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Meditation training has been shown to enhance attention and improve emotion regulation. However, the brain processes associated with such training are poorly understood and a computational modeling framework is lacking. Modeling approaches that can realistically simulate neurophysiological data while conforming to basic anatomical and physiological constraints can provide a unique opportunity to generate concrete and testable hypotheses about the mechanisms supporting complex cognitive tasks such as meditation. Here we applied the mean-field computational modeling approach using the scalp-recorded electroencephalogram ({EEG}) collected at three assessment points from meditating participants during two separate 3-month-long shamatha meditation retreats. We modeled cortical, corticothalamic, and intrathalamic interactions to generate a simulation of {EEG} signals recorded across the scalp. We also present two novel extensions to the mean-field approach that allow for: (a) non-parametric analysis of changes in model parameter values across all channels and assessments; and (b) examination of variation in modeled thalamic reticular nucleus ({TRN}) connectivity over the retreat period. After successfully fitting whole-brain {EEG} data across three assessment points within each retreat, two model parameters were found to replicably change across both meditation retreats. First, after training, we observed an increased temporal delay between modeled cortical and thalamic cells. This increase provides a putative neural mechanism for a previously observed reduction in individual alpha frequency in these same participants. Second, we found decreased inhibitory connection strength between the {TRN} and secondary relay nuclei ({SRN}) of the modeled thalamus after training. This reduction in inhibitory strength was found to be associated with increased dynamical stability of the model. Altogether, this paper presents the first computational approach, taking core aspects of physiology and anatomy into account, to formally model brain processes associated with intensive meditation training. The observed changes in model parameters inform theoretical accounts of attention training through meditation, and may motivate future study on the use of meditation in a variety of clinical populations.},

Here, we present a large-scale computational model of letter recognition based on deep neural networks 3,4, which develops a hierarchy of increasingly more complex internal representations in a completely unsupervised way by fitting a probabilistic, generative model to the visual input 5,6 . In line with the hypothesis that learning written symbols partially recycles pre-existing neuronal circuits for object recognition 7, earlier processing levels in the model exploit domain-general visual features learned from natural images, while domain-specific features emerge in upstream neurons following exposure to printed letters. We show that these high-level representations can be easily mapped to letter identities even for noise-degraded images, producing accurate simulations of a broad range of empirical findings on letter perception in human observers. Our model shows that by reusing natural visual primitives, learning written symbols only requires limited, domain-specific tuning, supporting the hypothesis that their shape has been culturally selected to match the statistical structure of natural environments 8 .},

	doi = {10.1007/s10827-015-0583-3},
	abstract = {Gamma-band synchronization has been linked to attention and communication between brain regions, yet the underlying dynamical mechanisms are still unclear. How does the timing and amplitude of inputs to cells that generate an endogenously noisy gamma rhythm affect the network activity and rhythm? How does such ”communication through coherence” ({CTC}) survive in the face of rhythm and input variability? We present a stochastic modelling approach to this question that yields a very fast computation of the effectiveness of inputs to cells involved in gamma rhythms. Our work is partly motivated by recent optogenetic experiments (Cardin et al. Nature, 459(7247), 663–667 2009) that tested the gamma phase-dependence of network responses by first stabilizing the rhythm with periodic light pulses to the interneurons (I). Our computationally efficient model E-I network of stochastic two-state neurons exhibits finite-size fluctuations. Using the Hilbert transform and Kuramoto index, we study how the stochastic phase of its gamma rhythm is entrained by external pulses. We then compute how this rhythmic inhibition controls the effectiveness of external input onto pyramidal (E) cells, and how variability shapes the window of firing opportunity. For transferring the time variations of an external input to the E cells, we find a tradeoff between the phase selectivity and depth of rate modulation. We also show that the {CTC} is sensitive to the jitter in the arrival times of spikes to the E cells, and to the degree of I-cell entrainment. We further find that {CTC} can occur even if the underlying deterministic system does not oscillate; quasicycle-type rhythms induced by the finite-size noise retain the basic {CTC} properties. Finally a resonance analysis confirms the relative importance of the I cell pacing for rhythm generation. Analysis of whole network behaviour, including computations of synchrony, phase and shifts in excitatory-inhibitory balance, can be further sped up by orders of magnitude using two coupled stochastic differential equations, one for each population. Our work thus yields a fast tool to numerically and analytically investigate {CTC} in a noisy context. It shows that {CTC} can be quite vulnerable to rhythm and input variability, which both decrease phase preference.},

	abstract = {Neural computation, which relies on the active storage and sharing of information, occurs within large neuron networks in the highly dynamic context of varying brain states. Whether such functions are performed by specific subsets of neurons and whether they occur in specific dynamical regimes remains poorly understood. Using high density recordings in the hippocampus, medial entorhinal and medial prefrontal cortex of the rat, we identify computing substates, or discrete epochs, in which specific computing hub neurons perform well defined storage and sharing operations in a brain state-dependent manner. We retrieve a multiplicity of distinct computing substates within each global brain state, such as {REM} and {nonREM} sleep. Half of recorded neurons act as computing hubs in at least one substate, suggesting that functional roles are not firmly hardwired but dynamically reassigned at the second timescale. We identify sequences of substates whose temporal organization is dynamic and stands between order and disorder. We propose that global brain states constrain the language of neuronal computations by regulating the syntactic complexity of these substate sequences.},

	abstract = {A new, non-parametric and binless estimator for the mutual information of a d-dimensional random vector is proposed. First of all, an equation that links the mutual information to the entropy of a suitable random vector with uniformly distributed components is deduced. When d = 2 this equation reduces to the well known connection between mutual information and entropy of the copula function associated to the original random variables. Hence, the problem of estimating the mutual information of the original random vector is reduced to the estimation of the entropy of a random vector obtained through a multidimensional transformation. The estimator we propose is a two-step method: first estimate the transformation and obtain the transformed sample, then estimate its entropy. The properties of the new estimator are discussed through simulation examples and its performances are compared to those of the best estimators in the literature. The precision of the estimator converges to values of the same order of magnitude of the best estimator tested. However, the new estimator is unbiased even for larger dimensions and smaller sample sizes, while the other tested estimators show a bias in these cases. © 2013 by the authors; licensee {MDPI}, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Models of networks of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire ({LIF}) neurons are a widely used tool for theoretical investigations of brain function. These models have been used both with current- and conductance-based synapses. However, the differences in the dynamics expressed by these two approaches have been so far mainly studied at the single neuron level. To investigate how these synaptic models affect network activity, we compared the single neuron and neural population dynamics of conductance-based networks ({COBNs}) and current-based networks ({CUBNs}) of {LIF} neurons. These networks were endowed with sparse excitatory and inhibitory recurrent connections, and were tested in conditions including both low- and high-conductance states. We developed a novel procedure to obtain comparable networks by properly tuning the synaptic parameters not shared by the models. The so defined comparable networks displayed an excellent and robust match of first order statistics (average single neuron firing rates and average frequency spectrum of network activity). However, these comparable networks showed profound differences in the second order statistics of neural population interactions and in the modulation of these properties by external inputs. The correlation between inhibitory and excitatory synaptic currents and the cross-neuron correlation between synaptic inputs, membrane potentials and spike trains were stronger and more stimulus-modulated in the {COBN}. Because of these properties, the spike train correlation carried more information about the strength of the input in the {COBN}, although the firing rates were equally informative in both network models. Moreover, the network activity of {COBN} showed stronger synchronization in the gamma band, and spectral information about the input higher and spread over a broader range of frequencies. These results suggest that the second order statistics of network dynamics depend strongly on the choice of synaptic model. © 2014 Cavallari, Panzeri and Mazzoni.},

	doi = {10.3389/fncom.2016.00059},
	abstract = {Previous work from our lab has demonstrated how the connectivity of brain circuits constrains the repertoire of activity patterns that those circuits can display. Specifically, we have shown that the principal components of spontaneous neural activity are uniquely determined by the underlying circuit connections, and that although the principal components do not uniquely resolve the circuit structure, they do reveal important features about it. Expanding upon this framework on a larger scale of neural dynamics, we have analyzed {EEG} data recorded with the standard 10-20 electrode system from 41 neurologically normal children and adolescents during stage 2, non-{REM} sleep. We show that the principal components of {EEG} spindles, or sigma waves (10-16 Hz), reveal non-propagating, standing waves in the form of spherical harmonics. We mathematically demonstrate that standing {EEG} waves exist when the spatial covariance and the Laplacian operator on the head’s surface commute. This in turn implies that the covariance between two {EEG} channels decreases as the inverse of their relative distance; a relationship that we corroborate with empirical data. Using volume conduction theory, we then demonstrate that superficial current sources are more synchronized at larger distances, and determine the characteristic length of large-scale neural synchronization as 1.31 times the head radius, on average. Moreover, consistent with the hypothesis that {EEG} spindles are driven by thalamo-cortical rather than cortico-cortical loops, we also show that 8 additional patients with hypoplasia or complete agenesis of the corpus callosum, i.e., with deficient or no connectivity between cortical hemispheres, similarly exhibit standing {EEG} waves in the form of spherical harmonics. We conclude that spherical harmonics are a hallmark of spontaneous, large-scale synchronization of neural activity in the brain, which are associated with unconscious, light sleep. The analogy with spherical harmonics in quantum mechanics suggests that the variances (eigenvalues) of the principal components follow a Boltzmann distribution, or equivalently, that standing waves are in a sort of “thermodynamic” equilibrium during non-{REM} sleep. By extension, we speculate that consciousness emerges as the brain dynamics deviate from such equilibrium.},

We propose a computational model of the hippocampal {CA}1 network, which describes the formation, dynamics and stabilization of place fields. We show that although somatic disinhibition is sufficient to form place fields, dendritic inhibition along with synaptic plasticity is necessary for place field stabilization. Our model suggests that place cell stability can be attributed to strong excitatory synaptic weights and strong dendritic inhibition. We show that the interplay between somatic and dendritic inhibition balances the increased excitatory weights, such that place cells return to their baseline firing rate after exploration. Our model suggests that different types of interneurons are essential to unravel the mechanisms underlying place field plasticity. Finally, we predict that artificially induced dendritic events can shift place fields even after place field stabilization. Copyright:},

Brains and neuronal networks must at the same time store information about the world and react to information in the world. We sought to measure how the activity of the network alters information flow from inputs to output patterns. Using neocortical column neuronal network simulations, we demonstrated that networks with greater internal connectivity reduced input/output correlations from excitatory synapses and decreased negative correlations from inhibitory synapses, measured by Kendalls τ correlation. Both of these changes were associated with reduction in information flow, measured by normalized transfer entropy ({nTE}). Information handling by the network reflected the degree of internal connectivity. With no internal connectivity, the feedforward network transformed inputs through nonlinear summation and thresholding. With greater connectivity strength, the recurrent network translated activity and information due to contribution of activity from intrinsic network dynamics. This dynamic contribution amounts to added information drawn from that stored in the network. At still higher internal synaptic strength, the network corrupted the external information, producing a state where little external information came through. The association of increased information retrieved from the network with increased gamma power supports the notion of gamma oscillations playing a role in information processing. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, {LLC}.},

We show that there exists an optimal intensity of intrinsic ion channel noise by which the outreach of the pacemaker extends optimally across the whole network. This stochastic resonance phenomenon can be further amplified via fine-tuning of the small-world network structure, and depends significantly also on the coupling strength among neurons and the driving frequency of the pacemaker. In particular, we demonstrate that the noise-induced transmission of weak localized rhythmic activity peaks when the pacemaker frequency matches the intrinsic frequency of subthreshold oscillations.

Hippocampal neuronal circuits comprise populations of relatively homogenous excitatory neurons, principal cells and exceedingly heterogeneous inhibitory neurons, the interneurons. Interneurons release {GABA} from their axon terminals and are capable of controlling excitability in every cellular compartment of principal cells and interneurons alike; thus, they provide a brake on excess activity, control the timing of neuronal discharge and provide modulation of synaptic transmission. The dendritic and axonal morphology of interneurons, as well as their afferent and efferent connections within hippocampal circuits, is central to their ability to differentially control excitability, in a cell-type- and compartment-specific manner. This review aims to provide an up-to-date compendium of described hippocampal interneuron subtypes, with respect to their morphology, connectivity, neurochemistry and physiology, a full understanding of which will in time help to explain the rich diversity of neuronal function.},

Lesions that block theta rhythm impair performance in tasks requiring reversal of prior learning, including reversal in a T-maze, where associations between one arm location and food reward need to be extinguished in favor of associations between the opposite arm location and food reward. Here, a hippocampal model shows how theta rhythm could be important for reversal in this task by providing separate functional phases during each 100-300 msec cycle, consistent with physiological data. In the model, effective encoding of new associations occurs in the phase when synaptic input from entorhinal cortex is strong and long-term potentiation ({LTP}) of excitatory connections arising from hippocampal region {CA}3 is strong, but synaptic currents arising from region {CA}3 input are weak (to prevent interference from prior learned associations). Retrieval of old associations occurs in the phase when entorhinal input is weak and synaptic input from region {CA}3 is strong, but when depotentiation occurs at synapses from {CA}3 (to allow extinction of prior learned associations that do not match current input). These phasic changes require that {LTP} at synapses arising from region {CA}3 should be strongest at the phase when synaptic transmission at these synapses is weakest. Consistent with these requirements, our recent data show that synaptic transmission in stratum radiatum is weakest at the positive peak of local theta, which is when previous data show that induction of {LTP} is strongest in this layer.},

	abstract = {Neuronal gamma oscillations have been described in local field potentials of different brain regions of multiple species. Gamma oscillations are thought to reflect rhythmic synaptic activity organized by inhibitory interneurons. While several aspects of gamma rhythmogenesis are relatively well understood, we have much less solid evidence about how gamma oscillations contribute to information processing in neuronal circuits. One popular hypothesis states that a flexible routing of information between distant populations occurs via the control of the phase or coherence between their respective oscillations. Here, we investigate how a mismatch between the frequencies of gamma oscillations from two populations affects their interaction. In particular, we explore a biophysical model of the reciprocal interaction between two cortical areas displaying gamma oscillations at different frequencies, and quantify their phase coherence and communication efficiency. We observed that a moderate excitatory coupling between the two areas leads to a decrease in their frequency detuning, up to ∼6 Hz, with no frequency locking arising between the gamma peaks. Importantly, for similar gamma peak frequencies a zero phase difference emerges for both {LFP} and {MUA} despite small axonal delays. For increasing frequency detunings we found a significant decrease in the phase coherence (at non-zero phase lag) between the {MUAs} but not the {LFPs} of the two areas. Such difference between {LFPs} and {MUAs} behavior is due to the misalignment between the arrival of afferent synaptic currents and the local excitability windows. To test the efficiency of communication we evaluated the success of transferring rate-modulations between the two areas. Our results indicate that once two populations lock their peak frequencies, an optimal phase relation for communication appears. However, the sensitivity of locking to frequency mismatch suggests that only a precise and active control of gamma frequency could enable the selection of communication channels and their directionality.},

This is in stark contrast to units in artificial neural networks that are generally linear apart from an output nonlinearity. If dendritic trees can be nonlinear, biological neurons may have far more computational power than their artificial counterparts. Here we use a simple model where the dendrite is implemented as a sequence of thresholded linear units. We find that such dendrites can readily solve machine learning problems, such as {MNIST} or {CIFAR}-10, and that they benefit from having the same input onto several branches of the dendritic tree. This dendrite model is a special case of sparse network. This work suggests that popular neuron models may severely underestimate the computational power enabled by the biological fact of nonlinear dendrites and multiple synapses per pair of neurons. The next generation of artificial neural networks may significantly benefit from these biologically inspired dendritic architectures.},

While transfer entropy was originally formulated in discrete time, in this paper we provide a framework for considering transfer entropy in continuous time systems, based on Radon-Nikodym derivatives between measures of complete path realizations. To describe the information dynamics of individual path realizations, we introduce the pathwise transfer entropy, the expectation of which is the transfer entropy accumulated over a finite time interval. We demonstrate that this formalism permits an instantaneous transfer entropy rate. These properties are analogous to the behavior of physical quantities defined along paths such as work and heat. We use this approach to produce an explicit form for the transfer entropy for pure jump processes, and highlight the simplified form in the specific case of point processes (frequently used in neuroscience to model neural spike trains). Finally, we present two synthetic spiking neuron model examples to exhibit the pertinent features of our formalism, namely, that the information flow for point processes consists of discontinuous jump contributions (at spikes in the target) interrupting a continuously varying contribution (relating to waiting times between target spikes). Numerical schemes based on our formalism promise significant benefits over existing strategies based on discrete time formalisms.},

In doing so, we draw attention to the important methodological distinction between topological analysis of binary or unweighted graphs, which have provided a popular but simple approach to brain network analysis in the past, and the topology of weighted graphs, which retain more biologically relevant information and are more appropriate to the increasingly sophisticated data on brain connectivity emerging from contemporary tract-tracing and other imaging studies.

	abstract = {We investigated interactions within chimera states in a phase oscillator network with two coupled subpopulations. To quantify interactions within and between these subpopulations, we estimated the corresponding (delayed) mutual information that—in general—quantifies the capacity or the maximum rate at which information can be transferred to recover a sender's information at the receiver with a vanishingly low error probability. After verifying their equivalence with estimates based on the continuous phase data, we determined the mutual information using the time points at which the individual phases passed through their respective Poincaré sections. This stroboscopic view on the dynamics may resemble, e.g., neural spike times, that are common observables in the study of neuronal information transfer. This discretization also increased processing speed significantly, rendering it particularly suitable for a fine-grained analysis of the effects of experimental and model parameters. In our model, the delayed mutual information within each subpopulation peaked at zero delay, whereas between the subpopulations it was always maximal at non-zero delay, irrespective of parameter choices. We observed that the delayed mutual information of the desynchronized subpopulation preceded the synchronized subpopulation. Put differently, the oscillators of the desynchronized subpopulation were “driving” the ones in the synchronized subpopulation. These findings were also observed when estimating mutual information of the full phase trajectories. We can thus conclude that the delayed mutual information of discrete time points allows for inferring a functional directed flow of information between subpopulations of coupled phase oscillators.},

	abstract = {Given two time series X and Y, their mutual information, I(X,Y)=I(Y,X), is the average number of bits of X that can be predicted by measuring Y and vice versa. In the analysis of observational data, calculation of mutual information occurs in three contexts: identification of nonlinear correlation, determination of an optimal sampling interval, particularly when embedding data, and in the investigation of causal relationships with directed mutual information. In this contribution a minimum description length argument is used to determine the optimal number of elements to use when characterizing the distributions of X and Y. However, even when using partitions of the X and Y axis indicated by minimum description length, mutual information calculations performed with a uniform partition of the {XY} plane can give misleading results. This motivated the construction of an algorithm for calculating mutual information that uses an adaptive partition. This algorithm also incorporates an explicit test of the statistical independence of X and Y in a calculation that returns an assessment of the corresponding null hypothesis. The previously published Fraser-Swinney algorithm for calculating mutual information includes a sophisticated procedure for local adaptive control of the partitioning process. When the Fraser and Swinney algorithm and the algorithm constructed here are compared, they give very similar numerical results (less than 4\% difference in a typical application). Detailed comparisons are possible when X and Y are correlated jointly Gaussian distributed because an analytic expression for I(X,Y) can be derived for that case. Based on these tests, three conclusions can be drawn. First, the algorithm constructed here has an advantage over the Fraser-Swinney algorithm in providing an explicit calculation of the probability of the null hypothesis that X and Y are independent. Second, the Fraser-Swinney algorithm is marginally the more accurate of the two algorithms when large data sets are used. With smaller data sets, however, the Fraser-Swinney algorithm reports structures that disappear when more data are available. Third, the algorithm constructed here requires about 0.5\% of the computation time required by the Fraser-Swinney algorithm. © 2005 The American Physical Society.},

Specifically, we studied networks in which incoming excitatory signals are normally cancelled by locally evoked inhibition, leaving the targeted layer unresponsive. Transmission can be gated 'on' by modulating excitatory and inhibitory gains to upset this detailed balance. We illustrate gating through detailed balance in large networks of integrate-and-fire neurons. We show successful gating of multiple signals and study failure modes that produce effects reminiscent of clinically observed pathologies. Provided that the individual signals are detectable, detailed balance has a large capacity for gating multiple signals. © 2009 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},
